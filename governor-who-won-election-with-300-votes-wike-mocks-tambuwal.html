If I wanted to scuttle this convention, I would have done that. And I told them.</p><p>“There are people you think are human beings but they are not. As far as I am concerned, [there is a] conspiracy. I have told everybody — go and bring your vote. Sokoto, Zamfara, Niger bring your votes. It’s not about the north. We have come to the point of bringing your votes so that people can win elections.</p><p>“I’ve never seen how people can violate procedure. Somebody I have spoken with and it is at that point he was speaking that he can say ‘I am withdrawing’. He now turned it back. I just said ‘look, this our party must not be destroyed.’</p><p>“I would have left where I was sitting and said ‘no this convention cannot hold except you allow me to talk’, and I would have flattened that who says he is a human being. When do you see a sitting governor who won an election with 300 votes, which vote will he give?</p><p>“So, it is God’s will. Whatever they are thinking may not be what will happen.”</p><p>Wike appreciated his supporters for their efforts, adding that his result at the primary showed that Rivers should not be “underrated”.</p><p>“I just want to thank you for your support, commitment, everything. You have shown the world that Rivers is one and our interest must be protected all the time. They underrate us, but now, they will not underrate us again. We have all it takes to do whatever we want to do.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5JqZqCnppq%2Fr7vRZq6hp12svK95xKWcnKyZpLtuw8itn2ZrYGV6t7vTnqpmr5mgsm65zpyirGWklrqjwdaao2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

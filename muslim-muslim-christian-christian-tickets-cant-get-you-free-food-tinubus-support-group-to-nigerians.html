The solution to the challenges confronting Nigeria does not rest on whether the running mate to Tinubu is Christian or Muslim.</p><p>“Nigerians are not interested in who becomes running mate to any of the presidential candidates. What they need is good governance that would guarantee security, stable polity and social-economic progress.”</p><p>Agbomhere added: “Nobody can carry a pass to the market based on Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian tickets for Asiwaju or any other Presidential candidate and get food items free. They only need a ticket that would guarantee the availability of products and economic empowerment to meet their needs.”</p><p>He stressed that the party both at the state and federal level is ready to support the candidacy of Tinubu irrespective of who eventually emerged as his standard-running mate.</p><p>Agbomhere insisted that it was within the constitutional rights of Tinubu to pick his running mate, irrespective of the religious affiliation of the person.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5BxZqato6G2rnnMrqqloZ1isKm%2ByKyropmeYrCpvsisq6KZnmLBqq%2FKnqusZZOWu7V5xp6rZrGfqnqnvsSeZJ%2Bnn5l6tbXNrpmuq12owrG8zqurZp%2BipMKxedOoZKehl5q%2Fqq3NrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

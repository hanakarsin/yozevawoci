He's well known on Moonshiners for occasionally picking a bad spot to set up his distilling operations, which has on at least one occasion gotten him into trouble, although it doesn't seem like he's ever been arrested.</p><p>Josh also accidentally set his house on fire during the show's 11th season while he was trying to make moonshine out of maple sap. Thanks to a combination of bad luck and slightly reckless decision-making, Josh always seems to be in trouble for one reason or another. Thankfully, this latest run of bad luck seems to have resulted in a broken leg, and nothing more serious than that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSjp6OderDDxKeq</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

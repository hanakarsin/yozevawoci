He won’t even come second. It will be Tinubu first, and Amaechi or Lawan second. His only hope is a consensus candidacy. Am I lying?”</p><p>Meanwhile, the National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Felix Morka has dismissed speculations</strong></a> indicating that the party is planning to zone its 2023 presidential ticket to the Northeast.</p><p>A report from Thisday had stated that the APC was working towards zoning its presidential ticket to the northeast, with the Senate President, <strong>Ahmad Lawan</strong> likely to emerge as its presidential candidate in the 2023 elections.</p><p>“Many in the South who have been strident in calls for the presidential ticket to be zoned to the South after eight years of Buhari in the saddle are not likely to be amused by this evolving development,” the report published on Wednesday, May 18, stated.</p><p>However, the publicity secretary explained on Wednesday, that the National Working Committee (NWC) of the APC has not taken such a step.</p><p>“There’s no such decision made by the National Working Committee,” Morka said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5ByZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm67zKiiq6Fdp7K3scClqmano567o63JqKpmp56hxm60zqmcZqyfYrSmwIyap5xlpJ6wrLHTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

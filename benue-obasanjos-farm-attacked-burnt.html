Maybe the land was not adequately compensated for so that’s why they decided to set fire on the farm.</p><p>“That is the only information I got from them.”</p><p>Ikyaaza, however, lamented that his men who attended to the fire incident were robbed and beaten by suspected robbers on their way back to Makurdi.</p><p>According to him, “In fact, my men while coming back in the night, armed robbers caught them, beat them seriously and collected all their handsets, so that was the compensation we (firefighters) got for fighting the fire at Obasanjo’s farm.</p><p>“Not all the farm was burnt. Some trees are still there, the seeds were saved.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5JqZpudnqqybrvBmqqappqkwG6ywKukZpmkqa6kt8SdZJutoqPBcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

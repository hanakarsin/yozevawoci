The record-breaking champion just so happens to be the most decorated female swimmer in Olympic history, after all."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Below, we take a look at Katie's parents and sibling, and what they've all said about each other during her journey to greatness.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Katie's older brother Michael (left) with their mom Mary Gen and dad David in 2017</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who are Katie Ledecky's parents?</h2><p>Katie was born on March 17, 1997, in Bethesda, Md., to David and Mary Gen Ledecky.</p><p>And it just so happens that Mary was a competitive swimmer herself, having competed back in college when she was a student at the University of New Mexico. She qualified for nationals three time while swimming for the Lobos. She would later go on to work as a hospital administrator, but it seems pretty clear that she passed some of that swimming talent to her daughter. Mary Gen's dad even has an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">aquatic center named after him</a> in Williston, N.D., after he'd advocated heavily for a town pool.</p><p>David, on the other hand, is an attorney (he attended both Harvard and Yale!). He and his wife have prioritized education within their family, which has certainly paid off for Katie, who graduated in 2020 from the prestigious Stanford University with a degree in psychology and a minor in political science. "We just want her to be happy," Katie's mom told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC Washington</a> in 2016 ahead of Katie's entering college.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@katieledecky</a><p>Katie with her big brother Michael in 2023</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who are Katie Ledecky's siblings?</h2><p>As it turns out, it wasn't just Katie's mom who inspired young Katie to get into the pool — it was also her older brother (and only sibling), Michael.</p><p>Katie told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WBUR</a> back in 2015 that when she was 6 and her brother was 9, she followed her brother to a summer league swim team. They both loved it so much that they opted to join a year-round team.</p><p>"And I swam with my brother throughout that and always followed him to the pool and wanted to be in the same group as him in everything," she explained. "I just always enjoyed swimming with him and I think that's how I really found my love of the sport. I think if I didn't have my brother swimming with me, I don't know if I would have loved it as much as I did and still do."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Katie Ledecky (@katieledecky)</a></p></figure><p>The two have been each other's biggest supporters over the years. As Michael wrote in a piece for the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvard Crimson</a> in 2016 while he was a Harvard student, "She has nerves of steel and works harder than anyone I know." He also noted that he is "her number one fan."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoK61tcRmo56clZi4unnPmqmepqSo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

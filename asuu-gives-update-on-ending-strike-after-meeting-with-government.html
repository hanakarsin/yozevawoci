He added that the government is claiming it has no funds.</p><p>According to Osodeke, such claims are simply unbelievable, stressing that the only thing the present administration is focused on is how to win the 2023 elections.</p><p>In his words, “The situation now is that it’s even worse than when we started. The government has not shown any responsibility on how to fund our university system and education in general.</p><p>“They only claim they don’t have funds, no one can believe that. There are no funds and one man can steal N109 billion and the government is trying to negotiate with him? The government has not shown any commitment.</p><p>“We met with them yesterday and they came with nothing. It is very sad that all Nigerian universities are closed and all the government is interested in, is how to win elections and Nigerian people are watching.”</p><p>It will be recalled that&nbsp;ASUU has been on strike since February 14 2022 and has vowed not to return to classes until the government meets its demands.</p><h2>ASUU Blackmailing Government – FG</h2><p>An aide to President Muhammadu Buhari, <strong>Lauretta Onochie</strong> has accused the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) of blackmailing governments in Nigeria.</p><p>The Special Assistant to the President on Social Media made <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>the accusation</a></strong> in a tweet via her Twitter handle on Tuesday.</p><p>Onochie called on the National Assembly to enact laws that would mandate the leadership of the union to pay the salaries of striking members.</p><p>The presidential aide said it is unfair for ASUU executives to live off the union’s dues alone and other members suffer the consequence of the strike.</p><p>She wrote: “ASUU has blackmailed every government in Nigeria. The National Assembly should enact a law that mandates ASUU to pay the salaries of striking members.</p><p>“The current situation where ASUU executives alone, live off union dues leaving members high and dry, is unfair to their members.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5BxZpqrpap6qLXVnqpmraCZrrWxjKilZp2embavs4ysq6uhm5p6orLTnqlmpZWawaq6xmauoqyYYrSwwsSrpaadnql8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

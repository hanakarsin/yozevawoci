And as President Kenyatta said yesterday correctly, he has no debt to nobody. He doesn't have my debt. Uhuru Kenyatta owes me nothing, he owes no community anything. There is only one debt that I share with Uhuru Kenyatta and that is the debt of uniting this country," he said.<h2>Ethnic politics</h2><p class=align-left>In what seemed like a thin-veiled attack on the president's Sagana meeting with Mt Kenya politicians, Ruto also said he could not backslide to the politics of ethnicity which he said was toxic to Kenyans.</p>"As the deputy president, I understand the folly of ethnic bigotry and tribal zealotry. I will not be invited to the politics of ethnic mobilisation and tribal arrangements."<p class=align-left>Earlier, his allies had dismissed Uhuru's consultative meeting in Sagana as ethnic mobilisation meant to benefit the privileged few.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/dc6e73b158f8986f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>I only made a promise to Kenyans, ask your person why he keeps coming for baton, Uhuru</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Ruto's key allies <a href=#>took issue with Uhuru for badmouthing the D</a><a href=#>P</a> and his hustler nation for his growing influence in the president's backyard.</p><p class=align-left>Kandara lawmaker Alice Wahome, Ruto's key point woman in the Mt Kenya region, said Uhuru's meeting with Central Kenya politicians could only be interpreted as ethnic mobilisation.</p>"I have listened to several video clips of H.E Uhuru Kenyatta.

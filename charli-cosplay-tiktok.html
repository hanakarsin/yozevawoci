While it isn’t explicitly obvious to the untrained eye, the cosplay community online was quick to point out that the moves they were doing in their “dance” were imitating that of anime character Chika, one of the characters of the Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai anime and manga.</p><p>Charli had been vacationing in the Bahamas with other members of the Hype House when the drama began to unfold. And shortly after getting off the plane on her way home, she posted another video to her account in order to apologize to her fans.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Charli apologized for her part in the cosplay video on TikTok.</h2><p>Charli titled her video “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to the cosplay community</a>,” and in it, she’s quick to accept responsibility for what she did and to apologize. "I just got off the plane to the cosplay community being not very happy with me. My friend [Madi] and I made a video where we were doing it [dancing] and it was completely taken the wrong way and I didn't mean for it to happen that way at all.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Charli went on to clarify that she wasn’t targeting the cosplay community, which tends to get made fun of a lot, and that she’s sorry if people thought that she was trying to bully them or bring the group down because that’s not at all the type of person she is.&nbsp;</p><p>She ended her apology by saying, ”I've learned from what happened and it will not happen again. I love you all so much.” Charli also asked fans to “please stay safe also with the corona stuff.” She sensibly added that people should be washing their hands and staying home as much as they can in light of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Reactions to Charli D'Amelio's apology video on TikTok.</h2><p>Of course, fans were quick to react to Charli’s apology video and many came to her defense, saying that people were being too sensitive. Fans said there was no need to apologize, that everyone makes fun of cosplayers and that it’s only “when Charli does it that it’s a problem.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><p>One fan commended her response, saying that Charli was setting a great example for when celebrities mess up by “continuing to prove that it’s not hard to be respectful and recognize that a mistake was made, no matter how big or small.”&nbsp;</p><p>It seems that the drama has already blown over, with both Charli and Madi posting several more TikToks since and lying low at home in self-quarantine.&nbsp;</p><p>For more content from Charli, follow her on her TikTok or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWivsuiZJyno6W5osWMraCkrJ%2Bg</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Red Lobster is in the red. On May 20, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Florida. This dire news came after 87 Red Lobster locations across more than 20 states were listed as “temporarily closed” or “unavailable."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During the 2020 pandemic, the number of diners dwindled (guest count is down <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">30 percent from 2019</a>, according to bankruptcy documents). Mismanagement is also to blame — the company has gone through five different CEOs since 2021.</p><p>When Red Lobster was sold to a private equity firm called Golden Gate Capital, the deal didn’t help the chain.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Getty Images</a></figure><p>Since the firm <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sold off Red Lobster’s real estate assets for 1.5 billion</a>, they had to lease their locations back. This meant that Red Lobster was paying increased rent to their parent company. Underperforming locations were also stuck in rental contracts they couldn’t afford. These issues resulted in the company spending over $200 million last year.</p><p>The hits kept on coming when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Gate Capital sold Red Lobster to Thai Union Group</a>, a large seafood supplier.</p><p>Despite cutting costs across the board, Thai Union reported a $19 million loss in the first nine months of 2023. By 2024, they shared their plans to exit the business.</p><p>“Sustained industry headwinds, higher interest rates and rising material and labor costs have impacted Red Lobster, resulting in prolonged negative financial contributions to Thai Union and its shareholders,” Thiraphong Chansiri, Thai Union’s CEO, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said in a statement</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Red Lobster (@redlobster)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram | @redlobster</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Death by endless shrimp?</h2><p>The final nail in Red Lobster’s coffin may have been a promotional deal. In 2023, the seafood chain announced that they were bringing back their endless shrimp promotion. The deal allows customers to enjoy endless shrimp for $20.</p><p>The promotion aimed to bring customers back into the locations. While it achieved that, the demand became too much. Soon, many locations even began running out of shrimp.</p><p>This reportedly played a major role in an $11 million loss in the company’s third quarter. The endless shrimp deal is now $25 and only available on Mondays.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the company</a>, the bankruptcy is intended to "drive operational improvements, simplify the business through a reduction in locations, and pursue a sale of substantially all of its assets."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Red Lobster (@redlobster)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram | @redlobster</a></figure><p>As of now, the remaining Red Lobster restaurants will stay open during the bankruptcy proceedings.

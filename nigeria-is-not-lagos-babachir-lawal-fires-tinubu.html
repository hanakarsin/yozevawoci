I knew it would happen, and that was why I spoke out then.</p><p>“You can’t appoint somebody just because he is your friend or loyal to you. Nigeria is not Lagos. Simply because you run a small ministry in Lagos does not give you the ability to run the economy of the country. Nigeria is complex.</p><p>“Nigeria’s economy does not normally follow the known pattern of economic operations—issues in Nigeria like demand and supply that are in the textbooks. The way Nigeria works is completely different from textbook economics.</p><p>“Let me give you an example. As a businessman, if you bid on a project, you did all your excellent presentations and PowerPoint, and it is expected that you will win the contract because you supported your bid with a better presentation.</p><p>“However, the owners of the projects gave it to their girlfriends. The way Nigeria’s economy operates is not like that of other countries. Our economy is complex, and we need people who understand Nigeria very well. We need people who understand that Lagos state is different from Enugu, Borno, Anambra, Sokoto, and Adamawa.</p><p>“Bola (Tinubu’s) appointment did not reflect this knowledge of the country, and he is reaping the consequences of it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FwZqehl5q%2Fqq2Moqpmpp%2Bpeq2txqiqZpqRl66ktMirZKWZp5a5brLIq5ysZaSeu7au1Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Source: Sonja Flemming/CBSNo season of Big Brother is without its twists, and Big Brother 26 is certainly no exception. Ahead of the premiere, CBS released some juicy details about the season's theme and subsequent surprises, including something called BB Artificial Intelligence, or BBAI."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But what is BBAI in Big Brother Season 26 and how might it affect the game this time around?</p><p>According to host Julie Chen Moonves in a video shared by CBS online, the season focuses on AI as its theme and as part of twists that can shake up the game. Viewers often wait for her iconic precursors of "but first" before she reveals details of the twists during any given season, so she didn't share too much before the premiere, but there are a few clues that have already been laid out about what BBAI is.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Monty Brinton/CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How does BBAI work on 'Big Brother'?</h2><p>Julie explains in her Big Brother preview video before the premiere that BBAI is the focus of how the house is designed. According to her, the house might at first look like it's just designed in a modern way. But if you look more closely, you can see details of AI, like a room that appears to be designed by AI, and some futuristic components in the design of the house.</p><p>According to CBS, the BBAI theme "will deliver the most unpredictable season for houseguests." Like other themes that came before it, BBAI is all about incorporating specific aspects into the game through twists and competitions. There could even be AI-generated surprises in the house once the houseguests get comfortable!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy <a href=#>#BB26</a> premiere day!

"This summer's 'BB AI' theme promises to bring the fun, the comedy, and the unexpected game play that is a hallmark of Big Brother."</p><p>During the Season 26 premiere, the first eight houseguests have the chance to collectively decide whether to invite a 17th player into the game. The possible new guest, Ainsley, then introduces herself as a quirky blue-haired surfer girl eager for a chance to compete.</p><p>Each player then casts their vote on whether to allow Ainsley to join the competition before a surprise unfolds. Upon revealing their votes, it becomes clear that Ainsley isn't a contestant or a real person but AI technology playing a trick on them.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span><p>Makensy reacts to Ainsley the AI in 'Big Brother 26.'</p></figure><p>After the deception is exposed, an eerie AI-generated blue figure appears on the screen.

How these results will affect their games remains unknown, but expect some answers during Part 2 of the Season 26 premiere on Thursday, July 18.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Big Brother 26' is set in the same filming location as recent seasons.</h2><p>Although there are plenty of surprises and new faces in Season 26, thanks to an all-newbie cast, the one thing that remains the same is where Big Brother is filmed. Before any of the details were released about the season, fans theorized that Season 26 would be filmed in a brand new location to totally liven things up.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I forgot the theme is AI, that’s probably not the real cast <a href=#>#BB26</a></p>— Ana (@vanonymous23) <a href=#>July 15, 2024</a></figure><p>However, judging by the many photos inside the BBAI house for Big Brother 26, it looks like the game is still being played on the huge sound stage in a CBS lot in Los Angeles.</p><p>Watch Big Brother on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays at 9 p.m. EST after the two-night premiere on July 17 and July 18.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecOonKxlkpeuqnnWqKmkZZKetG6u0airoZ2i</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

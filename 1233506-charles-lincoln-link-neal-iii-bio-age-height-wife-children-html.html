Their mischevious behaviour, of course, had consequence, and their teacher often gave them a punishment of colouring the pictures of beasts and mythical creatures. At this point, the duo had already become best of buddies in a lifelong friendship that has lasted over 30 years. According to Link, their friendship bond is akin to twins (fraternal) who got separated at birth.</p><h2>Did Rhett and Link attend college?</h2><p class=align-left>Interestingly, both friends went to Buies Creek Elementary School, same middle school, and finally sat for their high school exams in Harnett Central High School. Later on, both of them got the opportunity to join North Carolina State University, and they were roommates since day one.

But what happens when a representative for the business isn't into the idea of giving you the higher salary that you asked for?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You just have to be willing to ask and perhaps see what kind of little "boosts" or "add-ons" the business in question is able to slap onto your work contract.</p><p>He gave the run down in a video that's been liked nearly 27,000 times on the widely used video-sharing application, with over 200 viewers head-nodding to his suggestions in the comments section of the clip.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@rashadtheintern href=#>@rashadtheintern</a><p><a title=stitch href=#>#stitch</a> with @DeAndre Brown Salary negotiation can be very scary for us!! make sure you are practicing as well as are well prepared for your negotiation.

And I want to, I hope that this can be helpful for people who are just now graduating college or my black and brown students who are getting their first internships."</p><p>He continued, "If you negotiate your salary or you try to negotiate your salary and them people say no we don't got it in the budget, even if you follow exactly what he said because that was great advice, them people can give you something and I'm finna show you something the mentor gave me that I only give my best friends and my mentees."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @rashadtheintern</span></figure><p>RaShad went on to deliver the goods, "If them folks can't give you a salary increase, they can get you something. If companies don't want to give me the money I'm asking for...I'm finna to get something I want. My favorite things I've negotiated, better job title that's on the list, Fridays off, half-days on Thursdays and Fridays, I've negotiated bonuses..."</p><p>He rattled off even more perks he's managed to package into work contracts: "I've negotiated commissions...I feel like if y'all are nervous about this type of stuff and it does kind of scare you, the thing to remember is that companies are going to either make their money, or save money because they've employed you."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @rashadtheintern</span></figure><p>"That's just the way it works. The least that you can do and this is my mindset, is make sure that you're paid enough to where you can actually have the things that you want and need. Because a lot of times if you're early in your career, or you're doing an internship you might be getting underpaid."</p><p>There were a number of TikTokers who said that they agreed with RaShad's assessment of salary negotiations and that they, too, have been able to secure themselves better pay and/or benefits as a result of not being afraid to ask.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @rashadtheintern</span></figure><p>"Facts. I liked the salary my company offered but I was with my recruiter friend & she said: negotiate anyway. Walked away with a 35,000 sign on bonus," one individual wrote.</p><p>Another person in the comments section who said that they were a finance director also urged folks to try and get something while negotiating a new job, echoing the TikToker's sentiments: "Finance Director here. This is gold! Y‚Äôall better ask for SOMETHING! Every company has a discretionary fund. There‚Äôs money somewhere."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @rashadtheintern</span></figure><p>The phrase the aforementioned TikToker mentioned: "discretionary fund" is an amount of money that businesses keep on reserve that are considered "nonessential," finances, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Investopedia</a>. These funds are sometimes used for things like corporate gatherings, meals, outings, etc. and other functions not considered directly pertinent to vital operational functions.</p><p>In this instance, the trick would be to convince a business of forking over a portion of that nonessential spending as part of your new salary negotiation.</p><p>So how does one do that? Demonstrating value is a good start, as this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> article states, highlighting specific numbers, factors, and qualifiers, with specific markers and milestone achievements either in your current or previous role, when matched against current going rates for folks with similar levels of experience in your field, could be a great way to start.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqK6trdGyZKedl6TBqq3ToqanZaSWsLW1wqw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.

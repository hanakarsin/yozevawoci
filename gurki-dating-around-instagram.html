During their extremely intense date, the Miller High Life-ordering man child reveals that his thoughts on marriage do not align with Gurki’s views. We can chalk it up to cultural differences — or the fact that Justin was just plain ignorant.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Gurki tries to explain to Justin her background, revealing that her parents are India and were part of an arranged marriage, which is common for the culture. She delves further into her past explaining how her ex-husband was Punjabi; therefore, she felt pressure from both families to get married after dating for five years, even though she had her doubts.</p><p>Instead of being sympathetic or understanding of Gurki’s past, Justin takes the judgmental route. "Who says yes to getting married when you have doubts?" he asks Gurki. "You ruined eight years of your life. You lied to him and yourself. You agreed to spend the rest of your life with friends and family, and it was a complete lie. How could I ever trust you? How would anyone ever trust you?"</p><p>Just like Gurki, we were stunned by his outburst, and the "rosé all day" frat bro continued his verbal attack saying, that if she "can't handle that," then she shouldn't date at all.</p><p>WTF.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by GURKI BASRA (@gurkibasra)</a></p></figure><p>Showing his true colors, Justin tells his date, "I'm over this," before walking away.

Source: twitterNorth Farmington High School is the very definition of a cool school. But it's not because all of the students drive I-Roc Z Camaros, have front-row tickets to Whitesnake and wear denim jackets.
I mean, that could very well be the case, but that's not why I'm officially decreeing it cool."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But it's not because all of the students drive I-Roc Z Camaros, have front-row tickets to Whitesnake and wear denim jackets.</p><p>I mean, that could very well be the case, but that's not why I'm officially decreeing it cool. My reasoning has to do with a longstanding <a href=#>senior ID prank</a> that the school not only allows students to partake in, but even encourages.</p><p>For years, students have been bringing their dress-up A-game to picture day at NFHS, and the results are pretty incredible. The graduating class of 2019 showed up in a big way.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>You know things are serious when the school's Twitter account is putting their own students on blast to go hard for the long-time gag. And go hard they did. Like Olivia's awesome Ronda Rousey cosplay.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>There was some Disney Channel childhood nostalgia love as well as a nod to Legally Blonde. I would've gone the Clueless route myself, but this is great.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Oh snap, bringing back the '90s sitcom vibes with an Olsen twin cosplay? Jordyn you didn't have to go that hard but you did, and the internet thanks you for it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>No group school cosplay would be complete without a reference to The Office. Props to students for not being afraid to go the cartoon route. Pulling off a Powerpuff Girl in real life is no easy task, but she gothed it up perfectly with her Bubbles get-up.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>A lot of the students channeled their favorite celebrities from iconic memes, like side-lip-dissatisfaction Rihanna. It's not a cosplay fest without a Star Wars reference, either.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>There's so many iterations of Dwight Schrute that could lead to a successful prank photo. Two in one class is truly a blessing. Can we also just congratulate Erin on her creative use of props for her photo? The Magic School Bus lives!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>A for effort with the Progressive "Flo" character cosplay on Alli's part. But I think that out of all the students, Sydney really captured the heart of her character with Princess Diaries' big-hair Anne Hathaway. The facial expression is priceless.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Here we have two other students repping characters holding the respective items that define them. The first: New York, aka the only reason to watch Flavor of Love, unless you have an unhealthy obsession with crusty looking men rocking alarm-clock necklaces. As for Dan's Brick interpretation? Well, the only thing I have to say to that is "I love Lamp."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>The Colonel got the respect he deserves thanks to Alex's prank photo. The always-underrated Lilo & Stitch was brought to life thanks to Alyson's creative use of a Disney character plush. Truly thoughtful work.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Maddie probably wins best caption with her photo, but we can't overlook the sheer enthusiasm that Danielle managed to capture when repping Amy Adams' unforgettable character.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>As a not-so-young man myself, I appreciated that a lot of these youngsters are repping the classics, like the obnoxious girl from Willy Wonka along with the OG Captain James Kirk. Now excuse me while I listen to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shatner's Christmas album</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>I'm actually surprised there weren't more meme references in this collection, but the ones that did show up were choice. Of course, whenever there's any kind of dressing up to be done, there are going to be Harry Potter characters floating around.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Keeping the Disney love going, Julia nails her Anna outfit. Those braids are totally on point. 10 points to Gryffindor, and Anthony for his magical Dumbledore photo.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Audrey Hepburn. Bob Ross. Two American icons. Two people with amazing heads of hair. Alexa's got the high bun down pat and I'm pretty sure Lily's fro isn't real, but who cares, she's got the paint brush, palette, and obvious love for a public broadcasting legend.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>State Champs indeed. The class of 2020 is going to have to go hard to match this kind of excellence. Current juniors: step your game up and start planning today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKCloryze5FpaHFnYG58coCOk32tfHJrfLSxzaKmq2WZmXq1vsCdoK2hn6M%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

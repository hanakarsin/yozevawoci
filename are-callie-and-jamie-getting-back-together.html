After Callie and Jamie continued to keep fans guessing on whether or not they would rekindle their relationship, we finally have an answer.</p><p>Callie and Jamie are officially an item once again.</p><p>So far in Season 5, Callie returned to Los Angeles from Washington, D.C., to support her sister Mariana.</p><p>And on the March 23, 2023, episode, titled ‚ÄúIt Was Not Your Fault But Mine,‚Äù Callie revealed to her friends that she and Jamie are back on.</p><p>However, this time around things may be a bit more serious.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>please the way he looks at her, the way he loves her, they way he speaks to her ‚Ä¶ this is everything üíï <a href=#>#goodtrouble</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/SjDi59edXT</a></p>‚Äî sav rose (@lips_like_wine) <a href=#>March 24, 2023</a></figure><p>In one scene, Mariana inquired about how Callie and Jamie were doing. The scene immediately cut to Callie and Jamie enjoying a romantic dinner together.</p><p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so beautiful,‚Äù Jamie says to Callie.</p><p>Then he got down on one knee and pulled out a diamond ring.</p><p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt freak out,‚Äù Jamie tells a stunned Callie. ‚ÄúCallie, you‚Äôre the love of my life, my joy, my favorite client. I‚Äôve loved you since the day I met you, in your moms‚Äô backyard, and you gave me such a hard time. I want to share every sunrise and sunset with you. I want to support you in achieving your dreams. I want to have a family and grow old together. You‚Äôre my heart and my soul. You‚Äôre my everything. Callie Adams-Foster, will you make me the happiest man alive? Will you marry me?‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span></figure><p>Interestingly, the scene cut back to Callie and Mariana talking instead of showing her answer to Jamie‚Äôs proposal.</p><p>Since then, we haven‚Äôt seen Callie‚Äôs response, which potentially points to trouble between the newly rekindled couple.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will Callie and Jamie's relationship go the distance this time around?</h2><p>Truth be told, only time will tell if Callie and Jamie's reconciliation will last. After all, Callie and Jamie haven‚Äôt always been solely focused on each other.</p><p>In the past, Callie developed major feelings for her roommate Gael Martinez before he found out he was about to become a father with another woman. At first, Callie was extremely patient with Gael, even though he had impregnated someone else. But eventually, things fell apart.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span><p>Gael on 'Good Trouble'</p></figure><p>On the flip side, Jamie briefly tried to strike up a romance with his co-worker Nicolette. In fact, Callie ran into them during one of their dates!</p><p>But that didn't work out in the long run, and since neither Callie nor Jamie have had any luck in the romance department with other people, it‚Äôs possible that they're meant to be together.</p><p>New episodes of Good Trouble air Thursdays at 10 p.m. EST on Freeform and are also available to stream on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BmecKao6WhlWKur7CMo5imoZVitKbA06KloGWSlrCsedOonp6smJq%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.

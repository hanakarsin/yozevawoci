Because let's face it — watching Big Brother can sometimes feel like a full-time job, even if we all have fun doing it.</p><p>And, as much as some of us might claim we won't get pulled in this time around, it's hard to ignore the pull of the twists and competitions that the show offers each season. So, what is the Big Brother schedule for <a href=#>Season 26</a>? Surprisingly, it's a little easier to follow than that of previous seasons, even if it still requires appointment viewing three nights a week.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Monty Brinton/CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is the 'Big Brother' schedule for Season 26 and when is it on tonight?</h2><p>Before Season 26, Big Brother aired on Sundays and Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST and on Thursdays at 9 p.m. EST. For Season 26, however, things are a bit different. At first, the show aired on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays at 9 p.m. EST each day. That's not a huge deviation from the norm for this show, but it made it a little easier for fans to remember to tune in each night. Starting with the July 25 episode, however, there is a change in the Big Brother schedule.</p><p>Beginning on July 25, the Wednesday and Thursday episodes air at 8 p.m. EST. The Sunday episode remains in the 9 p.m. EST time slot. That doesn't mean there won't be the occasional Friday night episode or even a canceled Sunday night episode because of something else that airs for one night only during the season. But for the most part, we're looking at the usual three days every week of Big Brother.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#BB26</a> Producers: "We've shortened the season by 10 days BUT you can no longer rewind the live feeds."</p><p>Me: cool! wait what</p><p>BB: and delaying the feeds 48 hours</p><p>Me: what why</p><p>BB: and we're also upping the price</p><p>Me: STOP</p><p>BB: and voting for a 17th houseguest</p><p>BB: and adding AI <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zyHEQCSKjt</a></p>— Peridiam (@BillyGiese) <a href=#>July 16, 2024</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Are there still live feeds for 'Big Brother 26'?</h2><p>The live feeds for Season 26 began streaming on Thursday, July 18 at 10 p.m. PST after the two-night premiere ended. However, unlike former seasons where the live feeds a treasure trove of content and moments for hardcore viewers, there is one big change to them. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paramount Plus website</a>, starting with Season 26, live feed viewers can no longer go back and watch previously streamed live feed coverage.</p><p>Under a question about the live feed archives and flashbacks, this answer was shared: "Starting this season, archives and flashbacks are no longer available, but you can still watch all four cameras with the live feeds!" And some fans on Twitter weren't wild about this big change to a feature that has, in the past, allowed them to see some of the more scandalous moments from the show that didn't make it to the actual edited episodes.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>"This is a soft launch into removing feeds all together you cannot trick me. What do you mean I can't even rewind 15 seconds?" One user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> about the live feed change.</p><p>Another user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>, "Not to be dramatic but no rewind/flashbacks on live feeds this year has ruined my day and my excitement for the season. Being able to go back and watch everything that happened that led to Izzy being evicted for example was exciting, now we won't have that this year."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When is the 'Big Brother' finale?</h2><p>A 90-day season is on the horizon for Big Brother fans, and that means the late start to Season 26 gives viewers lots of fall content to eat up into October. The Big Brother 26 finale airs on Oct. 13, 2024.</p><p>Watch Big Brother on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST and Sundays at 9 p.m. EST on CBS and Paramount Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7aoecGrpq2glad6tLHArKanZWJrerSvx56brqSV</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

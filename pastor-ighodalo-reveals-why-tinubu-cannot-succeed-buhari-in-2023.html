Or you are just trying to put on your CV that you became president of Nigeria?</p><p>“We don’t have time for that anymore in Nigeria, we want people who really want to serve the people, people who are really ready to lay themselves down for the people, people who have vision for Nigeria, people who are bold enough to take the right decision and not going to offer us on the altar of politics and compromise us just because they want something or the other and take us back to square one again and we are suffering all over the place.”</p><p>Speaking further, the popular clergyman said the National leader of the APC has done well producing many leaders.</p><p>Pastor Ighodalo stated that Tinubu should instead be thinking of how to unite Nigerians to select a person who will be able to take the country forward .</p><p>He said: “I am looking for that righteous person who is ready to stop all these corrupt practices and not dashing people money, but using the money to educate them, build schools, hospital and laying infrastructures.</p><p>“What drives an economy is production, the ability to transform raw materials into finished goods. When you continue producing, there will be more than enough for everybody to consume.</p><p>“We want leaders that will encourage production, it means that the constitution of Nigeria must be changed and fashioned in such a way that there can be complete production of all the resources of Nigeria.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49yZqmZo6m8s3nIoJ%2BonJGhvG6%2BxK%2BcmqSjYsSpxYytoKetkqp6pK3Np6atZaOqsKSxxJ1km62Ylr%2BqecinZGtoYmh8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

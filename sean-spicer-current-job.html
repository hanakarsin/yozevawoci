Additionally, he will also resume his duties at the White House — as a member of the President's Commission on White House Fellowships.&nbsp;</p><p>These developments mark the former press secretary's return to politics. Unlike his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">current job</a> — he is the president of RigWil LLC — these will allow him to continue his career as a media figure.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Sean Spicer is about to return to the mediascape — as a talk show host.</h2><p>Sean garnered widespread scrutiny soon after assuming the role of the press secretary, notes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Business Insider</a>. A few days into the job, he made waves with a fib concerning the number of attendants present at the 2017 presidential inauguration.</p><p>"[...] the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period," Sean stated on January 22, 2017.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>The debacle came to taint Sean's entire career as a press secretary. At the 2017 Emmy Awards, he tried to turn it into a butt of a few jokes, presenting a comedy skit poking fun of the mix-up.</p><p>Alongside his use of "alternative facts," Sean also garnered criticism over remarks concerning Nazi gas chambers and a set of ill-thought-out comments on the diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Russia.&nbsp;</p><p>"If the president puts Russian salad dressing on his salad tonight, somehow that's a Russian connection," held one of Sean's claims cited by The Business Insider.&nbsp;</p><p>Sean resigned from his role as a press secretary after seven months, in what became one of the shortest tenures since its launch in 1929.&nbsp;</p><p>As his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> profile reveals, he signed with Worldwide Speakers Group — a global professional services firm that counts prominent economists like Stanley Fisher and politicians like Robert B. Zoellick among its employees — in September 2019, the same month as his resignation.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Sean published a book detailing his experiences as a press secretary, titled The Briefing: Politics, the Press, and the President in July 2018. He launched a strategic consultations firm, RigWil LLC in the spring of 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PR Week</a> reveals. He also serves as a partner at Point1, as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>.&nbsp;He also featured in Season 28 of Dancing with the Stars, though he was voted off after just eight episodes. Aside from this public appearance, he strove to keep a relatively low profile for the past years.&nbsp;</p><p>In February 2019, Sean made the headlines with an unconventional campaign aiming to raise donations for Independence Fund, a charity helping veterans in need. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a> notes, the former press secretary offered to record personalized Valentine's Day messages in exchange for $199.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Spicer & Co.' will offer a fresh perspective on political discussions.</h2><p>The new program aims to foster informal conversations about political developments. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> reveals, it will also feature segments on sports and entertainment news.&nbsp;</p><p>"It’s less focused on news and is more of a conversation about the news and issues of the day," Sean told the outlet.&nbsp;</p><p>"It’ll be a cross-section — not just politics, but folks that are in entertainment and sports. The topics we’re going to cover will tilt right, but the idea is to have a discussion. You’re not going to have talking points thrown at you or just hear one side. It will be a holistic discussion," the newly-appointed show host added.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLKiuoysp6Kblad6pMHRq5ynrF2fvKM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

It is a straight fight between the Atiku camp and Bola Tinubu’s camp. The thinking is that Buhari will be too old to run for office by then so the camps want to consolidate their grip on power before then,”</i> the lawyer said, warning that failure to address the issue amicably would damage the survival and success of the party.</p><p>Recall that Atiku was recently sighted with some Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governors, having a nice time with people who were supposed to be in he opposition.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXaFmGtuZqyZo8KjwYyapZ1lkam2rMGMoZivnV2XsqjBzWZpaWlpYr2zsdKim56mpJ6urXnBmqutpJVjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

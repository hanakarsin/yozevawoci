Here's where each couple stands today.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: netflix</a></figure><p><strong>Spoiler alert: This article contains spoilers for Season 4 of </strong><strong>Love Is Blind</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>Season 4 of <a href=#>Netflix</a>'s <a href=#>Love Is Blind</a> premiered on March 24 and introduced us to a new batch of <a href=#>30 hot singles</a>. And after hours and hours of talking through a wall in hopes of finding a soulmate, five couples formed. They are as follows: <a href=#>Kwame and Chelsea</a>; <a href=#>Zack and Irina</a>; <a href=#>Marshall and Jackie</a>; <a href=#>Brett and Tiffany</a>; and <a href=#>Paul and Micah</a>. And then a few of them un-formed and we got two new couples: <a href=#>Zack and Bliss</a>, and <a href=#>Jackie and Josh</a>. Below, we list each couple and where they are now.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kwame and Chelsea</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p><a href=#>Chelsea and Kw</a>ame had a bit of a rough start. Basically, Kwame only ended up with her because his first choice, Micah, got engaged to someone else. Things get messy when it becomes clear that Kwame still has Micah on the brain and needs closure from her in Episode 4. However, he and Chelsea move forward with their wedding plans (even despite the apparent lack of support from Kwame's parents).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kwame Appiah (@ayokwam)</a></p></figure><p>Episode 11 ends in a cliffhanger at the altar as we wait to see whether Kwame will say "I do." But in the first scene of Episode 12, he does! Chelsea and Kwame officially get married. After Episode 12 dropped on Netflix, Kwame shared some photos of him and Chelsea where he appears to have a ring on his left hand. Chelsea shared some photos from their wedding in her Stories, but her grid featured mostly pictures of herself (with no apparent engagement or wedding ring).</p><p>At the live reunion, we learned that Chelsea and Kwame are still married and apparently going strong! They moved into a swanky <a href=#>apartment in Seattle</a> (even though Kwame had spoken about wanting to remain in Portland) which is big enough for the two of them, Rocky the dog, and Baba the baby blanket.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Zack and Irina</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p><a href=#>Zack and Irina</a> called it quits early on in Season 4. In the fifth episode, they mutually decide to split. Irina just doesn't feel attracted to Zack, and he feels neglected by the way she's treating him.</p><p>In a shocking turn of events, Zack meets up with Bliss post-breakup, and the two of them decide to move forward together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Zack and Bliss</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Despite getting an even shorter amount of time together than the rest of the couples, <a href=#>Zack and Bliss</a> seem determined to make things work — even after <a href=#>Bliss's dad</a> gives Zack the third degree.</p><p>In Episode 12, they both make the decision to get married (and then go on the vacation they missed out on while Zack was with Irina). As they discussed in the pods, they had their first dance to "I Hope You Dance" by Lee Ann Womack, and it was a very adorable moment.</p><p>At the reunion, Zack and Bliss revealed that they are still together, and they seem to be happier than ever!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Marshall and Jackie</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: netflix</span></figure><p>Jackie and Marshall called off their engagement before making it down the aisle.</p><p>While their relationship had some sweet moments, they seemed like polar opposites. Not to mention that Jackie revealed in a confessional that if she saw Marshall on a dating app, she would swipe no because she usually opts for guys who are taller than 6-foot-5-inches with tattoos and basketball skills.</p><p>Plus, Jackie broke down in Mexico crying over the pressure of marriage. She later admitted to having feelings for her ex and co-star <a href=#>Josh Demas</a>, and <a href=#>Marshall actually briefly dated Kacia</a>, a fellow Love Is Blind contestant.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jackie and Josh</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>In Episode 9, Jackie and Marshall call it quits for good, and Jackie meets up with Josh at a coffee shop. (It's worth mentioning that on the show, the coffee shop meeting takes place before the breakup, but Jackie said on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> that it happened the other way around in real life.)</p><p>According to some <a href=#>leaked texts</a> that were supposedly from Jackie, she and Josh became an official item. Sure enough, at the reunion, we saw a pre-recorded interview with them and they revealed that they are still dating. Josh also said that they now live together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brett and Tiffany</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>If we had to pick which Season 4 couple is the most compatible, we would have to say <a href=#>Brett and Tiffany</a>. Unlike other couples, their connection has always been solid. They only have eyes for each other and no one else.</p><p>So, are they still together? In Episode 12, they get married (allowing us to all breathe a sigh of relief and continue believing in love). There's a little bit of drama when Brett's suit has to be fixed at the last minute, but it's nothing that Lucia the wonder tailor can't fix.</p><p>At the reunion, Brett and Tiffany revealed that they are still together — and they look as solid as ever! They moved into a new apartment and are living their best lives in wedded bliss.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Paul and Micah</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p><a href=#>Micah and Paul</a> make it to their wedding day in Episode 12, but both seem to be having serious doubts while waiting at the venue. Paul in particular seems to be very unsettled about what he should choose, and it soon becomes clear why. After Micah tells him to answer first at the altar, Paul says that while he loves Micah, he doesn't think getting married is best for both of them.</p><p>Later, in a confessional, Paul admits that he has had a hard time imagining Micah as a mother, and implies that she lacks the nurturing quality he is looking for. Micah also shares that she had been feeling like she wanted more validation from Paul. Ultimately, things didn't work out for this couple, but they both insist that love is still blind because their feelings for one another were real before they ever saw one another in person.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoby3sYyiqmaanJ67pXnSnpisp55igW6vzq6npZ2jYruwww%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

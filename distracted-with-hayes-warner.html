I know I‚Äôd regret it afterwards, but I‚Äôve definitely thought about getting "H20" tattooed on my arm or forehead or something, just to give me a little nudge every time I look at it and remind myself to get hydrated.</p><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">What‚Äôs your most-used emoji?</h2><p><strong>HW:</strong> I definitely use the girl in the red dress dancing a lot. It's my go-to move to soften the blow of bad news, or add a bit of spice when I admit to messing something up. You know, like, "Oops, running late, sorry! üíÉüèª"</p><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">Talk about the best fan interaction you‚Äôve ever had.</h2><p><strong>HW:</strong> I‚Äôll never forget the first person who DM‚Äôd me when I dropped my first song and told me that she related to the lyrics. It was wild to have a total stranger connect with my music. She‚Äôs from Washington D.C., and a few weeks ago I was playing a show in Washington D.C. opening for Flo Rida, and she came.</p><p>It was so fun to see her ‚Äî we‚Äôve been chatting, and she‚Äôs been so supportive with all of the songs I‚Äôve been releasing these past few years. So, my best fan interaction was definitely getting to finally meet my first fan in person a few weeks ago!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@hayeswarner</span></figure><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">Tell us about the first concert you ever attended.</h2><p><strong>HW:</strong> When I was six years old, I went to a Black Eyed Peas concert with my kindergarten friend and her parents. It was their ‚ÄúBoom Boom Pow‚Äù era and they played at Madison Square Garden. It was definitely a key memory. Ludacris opened for them, and in the middle of his set, he told the whole crowd to give the world a ‚Äúmiddle-finger salute.‚Äù I obviously joined in, and that was my first-ever time flipping someone off, haha.</p><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">If you could start any rumor about yourself, what would it be?</h2><p><strong>HW:</strong> That I was slimed at the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards. Or, that I won the 2008 Zach and Cody Danimals Yogurt sweepstakes contest.</p><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">Who or what is your biggest musical inspiration?</h2><p><strong>HW: </strong>One of my biggest inspirations is definitely Hayley Williams/Paramore. I‚Äôm also obsessed with Gwen Stefani, Joan Jett, and Blondie.</p><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">Who was your childhood celebrity crush?</h2><p><strong>HW: </strong>Cody Simpson (the "All Day" music video broke my heart) and Justin Russo from Wizards of Waverly Place.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">Shout out one of your favorite fellow creators!</h2><p><strong>HW:</strong> Loren Gray is the best ‚Äî she‚Äôs hilarious and a boss businesswoman! We just released a song together: ‚ÄúBreadcrumbs!‚Äù</p><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">What‚Äôs your go-to karaoke song?</h2><p><strong>HW:</strong> "Life Is a Highway" by Rascal Flatts, "Club Can‚Äôt Handle Me" by Flo Rida, and "Promiscuous Girl" by Nelly Furtado.</p><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">Tell us about your dream musical collaboration.</h2><p><strong>HW:</strong> I have been obsessed with Chappell Roan‚Äôs newest album, "The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess." I would LOVE to collaborate with her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Hayes Warner (@hayeswarner)</a></p></figure><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">If you couldn‚Äôt be a musician, what would your dream job be?</h2><p><strong>HW:</strong> Growing up, I was dead set on becoming a veterinarian. But turns out I kind of confused my love for cute animals with the whole vet thing. I think I would pass out if I saw a sick animal. So maybe the right answer to that is just getting a cat or lizard.</p><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">Share your top three desert-island necessities.</h2><li>Pre-popped popcorn</li><li>40 buckets of Dunkin' iced coffee</li><li>Wheat Thins</li><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">What‚Äôs your No. 1 distraction?</h2><p><strong>HW:</strong> I know this is probably an obvious one, but I just spent the last 3 hours aimlessly scrolling on TikTok. Also I get sucked into scrolling through Netflix without actually choosing something to watch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmba0wNGamq2dlGLEqsDHZp%2BasZWoerit0aecqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.

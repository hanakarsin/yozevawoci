This season, the legal drama starts in an alternate reality in which Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election, but the world isn’t the idyllic utopia you may imagine.&nbsp;</p><p>Much of the magic of The Good Fight is derived from the delirious and zany tone that the show runners use to highlight life as a liberal under the Trump administration. And in these increasingly crazy and unsettling days, the surreal direction the show has taken often feels like a direct reflection of the real world we are living in.</p><p>But what brings this world truly alive are the beloved characters played by Christine, Cush Jumbo, Rose Leslie, <a href=#>Delroy Lindo, and the rest of the unparalleled cast</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of this stellar ensemble, this season, the show also adds a slew of <a href=#>unmissable guest stars</a>, which includes none other than Distractify favorite, <a href=#>Raúl Esparza</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Raúl Esparza guest stars on Season 4 of 'The Good Fight.'</h2><p>In the trailer for Season 4 of The Good Fight, Diane and the rest of the lawyers at Reddick, Boseman & Lockhart must adapt to their new corporate bosses, a multinational firm called STR Laurie. At the same time, Diane comes to learn about a new change in the legal system known simply as Memo 618, which seems to allow wealthy people to use their influence to not comply with court decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>In the recently dropped trailer, fans were also delighted to see a heavily bearded, sinister looking Raúl Esparza make a two-second appearance. Although not a lot is revealed about the character that he’ll play on the show, his demeanor in the short appearance he makes seems annoyed as all hell.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>He also appears when Diane is explaining the implications of the mysterious "Memo 618,"&nbsp;which suggests&nbsp;Raúl&nbsp;may play a wealthy individual who’s trying to get out of complying with the law.&nbsp;</p><p>You know Raúl Esparza from his previous recurring role as <a href=#>Assistant District Attorney Rafael Barba</a> on <a href=#>Law and Order: Special Victim’s Unit</a>, and as Dr. Frederick Chilton in the chilling NBC series, Hannibal. Raúl also had a recurring voice role in Netflix's beloved animation&nbsp;<a href=#>BoJack Horseman</a>, as the mild-mannered mouse Ralph Stilton.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who else guest stars on Season 4 of 'The Good Fight'?</h2><p>Raúl Esparza will be joined by a number of extraordinary guest stars that includes Michael J. Fox, as recurring guest character Louis Canning, a New York attorney who suffers&nbsp;from tardive dyskinesia, a condition that causes erratic body movements and which Louis happily uses to his clients' advantage by gaining sympathy from the judge or jury.&nbsp;</p><p>The show will also feature appearances by Hugh Dancy as a former military officer working as an associate in the multinational firm that takes over Reddick, Boseman & Lockhart, and Rachel Dratch who you know from her years on Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock.</p><p>Catch the premiere of The Good Fight on Thursday, April 9 on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS All Access.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp662uIyeqqmZoq%2BubsDHnmSgp5%2BZeqe1xqGr</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

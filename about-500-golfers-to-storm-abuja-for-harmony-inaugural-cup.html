We have professionals that don’t have the means of sponsoring themselves.</p><p>“Once you identify a talent, you support them, we have quite a number that we have done, either as a club or as individuals.</p><p>“I know that quite a number of us here have the privilege, but once talents are identified we support them, quite a number of them have gone to South Africa, some are right now in Zimbabwe; they were training to become professional golfers and that is an opportunity they have to launch themselves into both the local and international scene”.</p><p>Yakubu noted that “for the children, in fact, in a week’s time, we will kick start what we call the Children’s Clinic.</p><p>It normally comes every summer and in a week, the children will assemble and nobody takes record of who their parents are.</p><p>We are sponsoring this one here, a few weeks ago, we did one in Kaduna…and all over the country to stimulate the interest of the younger ones in this game of golf and to remove that impression that it is an elitist game.”</p><p>The ex-GMD of NNPC recalled that the club held its Annual General Meeting in April where it elected a new leadership led by the Captain 2022, <strong>Michael Onoja Ekoja</strong>, who is the 25th captain of the club.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5BtZpqan6rBboGPaWSgp5ybsrO%2FjK2mZqukpL%2BuecCbrKOZXZu8s3nHmqmmp56ueqq6wK6erqqRoXqkwc9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The man approach a pickup truck and begin walking around the vehicle until one of them ultimately gets into the bed of the car.</p><p>At one point in the video, one of the criminals can be seen breaking out the back window and start to place themselves inside of the whip as the auto expert breaks down exactly what is going on.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@durhamautohaus href=#>@durhamautohaus</a><p>Car theft thieves are getting smarter but we will always be one step ahead of them üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <a title=cartheft href=#>#cartheft</a> <a title=stolen href=#>#stolen</a> <a title=toronto href=#>#toronto</a> <a title=ram1500 href=#>#ram1500</a> <a title=thieves href=#>#thieves</a> <a title=greenscreenvideo href=#>#greenscreenvideo</a> <a title=igla href=#>#IGLA</a> <a title=compustar href=#>#compustar</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Durham Autohaus" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Durham Autohaus</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @durhamautohaus</span></figure><p>"These thieves are getting smarter and smarter. Both of these trucks are equipped with anti-theft devices. We install IGLA and Compustar in both of them. You can see the theft deterrent LED lights blinking of the front of these trucks and these criminals do not care."</p><p>The TikToker continued to talk about the highly capable criminals, "The alarm that we installed into these trucks have glass brake sensor, tilt sensor, and shock sensor. Now let's talk about the shock sensor. The shock sensor will go off when it senses impact."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @durhamautohaus</span></figure><p>He then goes on to detail how the car thieves were able to adequately implement a series of precautions in getting into the vehicle that'll allow for them to break into the truck without triggering the installed alarm.</p><p>"Now these thieves, you're gonna notice, they're gonna politely crawl onto the back of the bed of this truck to make sure that they do not trigger that shock sensor. Now the glass break sensor will be triggered when it senses the frequency of glass breaking. This is why this criminal's gonna cover up the back glass with his jacket, muffling the frequency of the glass breaking."</p><p>He said that as a result of this method they were ultimately able to "bypass the glass break sensor."</p><p>The TikToker continued, "They've gone pretty far so far, buddy's out here is gonna give his boy inside his little Amazon device to try and start this truck."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @durhamautohaus</span></figure><p>However, they would soon realize that their plan wasn't as fool proof as they would hope, as the shock sensor in the vehicle was sensitive enough to register the thief's movement, stopping them from driving off with the car to take it to wherever to do whatever they wanted with it.</p><p>"All of their hope is gonna come crashing to an end because the movement of him inside of this truck was enough to trigger the shock sensor. Setting off the alarm scaring them away, keeping my client's trucks on her driveway. This is another win."</p><p>The business owner writes in a caption for his clip that although the car thieves demonstrated enough knowledge of alarm systems to successfully break into the vehicle, the protocols they put in place worked well enough to keep them from driving off with the car for good: "Car theft thieves are getting smarter but we will always be one step ahead of them"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @durhamautohaus</span></figure><p>Numerous TikTokers offered up their own ideas and prospective solutions for bolstering the security of the alarm system, indicating that proximity sensors and immobilizers, with codes that must be input into the vehicle in order to start it, are other great ways to stymie crooks from making off with your vehicle.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @durhamautohaus</span></figure><p>Have you ever had your car broken into or stolen? Do you wish that you have a fortified enough of an alarm system to stop that from happening?</p><p>It does kind of stink that the customer will have to pay to get their back window replaced, however, since they have the incident captured on camera, here's hoping they can get this over to their insurance provider.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWqsdWeqmaZopp6qLHTraCnn12ouqK%2B056p</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.

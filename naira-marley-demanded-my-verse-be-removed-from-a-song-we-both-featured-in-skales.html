His name is Harmonize.</p><p>“So he was working on his album, he came to Nigeria. I remember I took him to Naira Marley’s house. It was all good vibes and everything. The song he did with Naira Marley, he hit me up and said I want you to give me a verse on this song. And I did it. I sent it to him. It was dope. He was like, I like it blablabla. Then weeks later, he called me and said, ‘Do you have a beef with Naira Marley?’ And I was like, ‘Beef? We were all chilling. What is going on?”</p><p>“He was like, ‘Naira Marley just called me and told me to take your verse off the song that he didn’t know I was going to be the artist involved.’ I was like, cool mehn, bro you need this thing to happen so take me off it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e49wZqeZmaeubrnAq6OesV2Zsq6tzZ2cnWWdrnq3sdGsnGaalWK%2FprnOr5ydZZanvK55wGaqqKaXYsSmecGoq6FllpqutcHRnptmoZ5iwKyty56qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

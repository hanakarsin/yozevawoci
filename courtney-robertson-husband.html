From <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">snuggles with the cat</a> to cuddle time with dad <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">while watching football</a>, their world was filled with love. But of course, there is always room for more.</p><p>In a very sweet <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post from July 6, 2021</a>, Courtney announced that she and Humberto were expecting baby number two. She used the hashtag 17 weeks pregnant under a photo of a mighty baby bump. A few weeks later, Courtney dropped the news that their second child was a girl. Their daughter, Paloma, was born a bit early on Nov. 21, 2021. Although she weighed 4 pounds, 15 ounces, Paloma did just fine.

The two young parents were reportedly seen getting cozy, and although nothing was confirmed at that time, it seems like they've once again rekindled their relationship.</p><p>Fans have long been hoping that the pair will reunite as a couple. But, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Flo Milli</a> sharing a photo with the "Stargazing" rapper, fans have been on a warpath. Read on to get the scoop.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Fans believe that Flo Milli's photo with Travis Scott may be her trying to make a romantic move.</h2><p>Rapper Flo Milli is just as confused as many of us after a photo of her and Travis Scott went viral. While the photo itself didn't give anyone the feeling that the two may be romantically linked, the text that accompanied the image in her Instagram story rubbed many Kylie fans the wrong way.</p><p>"Real-life Barbie and Ken vibes," along with a heart emoji read the text in the Instagram story.</p><p>Usually, when people refer to Barbie and Ken, it's in regards to a relationship. But, the photo seems to be very harmless.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>After Kylie's fans flocked to Flo Milli's page to share unfavorable comments about the photo, the rapper made it a point to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">share via Twitter that it's not that serious</a>.

It seems like it, but the details are still not confirmed.</h2><p>Rumors about Kylie and Travis's reunion began when the Instagram star and cosmetics mogul took a trip from California to Miami to party with Travis Scott for his 29th birthday party in spring of 2021, which led tons of people to speculate that they were officially an item once again, especially since they have a daughter together.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, a source said, "They were very close and affectionate. They kept flirting and looked happy." This seemed to be corroborated by one of Kylie's Instagram stories, which showed her sticking her foot out to touch Travis while he's dancing.</p><p>"They definitely seemed to be together, without making a big deal of being together," another insider said.</p><p>Even though Kylie was seen in attendance with Travis and another group of friends to have dinner at Komodo before going to a performance the artist was slated to give at club LIV, the first source said that the two weren't completely committed to one another at that time.</p><p>"[They are] not fully back together. Even after they split, they always spent a lot of time together."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The source continued, "They are great co-parents and love hanging out. They share a fun life with Stormi, but have separate homes. They haven't dated anyone else seriously since they split though. It always seemed possible that they would get back together."</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, however, it appears that the two have decided to see each other romantically again but aren't exclusive. After their split, the couple was openly supportive of one another on social media and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had only kind things to say about one another</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While sightings of the two post-split were reported as early as June 2020, they were photographed taking their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">3-year-old daughter Stormi to Disneyland</a> on Tuesday, May 18, 2021, together.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott seen together today at Disneyland with Stormi ü§ç <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/g8jfbzQrr5</a></p>‚Äî SAINT (@saint) <a href=#>May 18, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Kylie Jenner rejected the claims that she and Travis Scott are in an open relationship, however.</h2><p>She posted a screenshot of a Daily Mail article on Twitter that averred she and the artist are dating but not exclusively, stating, "You guys really just make up anything.

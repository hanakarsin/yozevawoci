Source: ABCThere's always a love triangle that forms during any given season of Bachelor in Paradise, but it's rare for it to include someone who is not even on the beach. During the Season 7 premiere of the hit ABC reality series, returning star Tahzjuan Hawkins (who first appeared on Colton Underwood's season of The Bachelor) immediately formed a connection with Katie Thurston's ex, Tre Cooper."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"I don't think he knows."</p><p>The realtor then shared that she met Tre's family member on a dating app, and that the two had kissed.</p><p>"It's tough for me, because that's my blood relative, obviously," Tre later explained in his own interview. "That's my mom's brother."</p><p>Though Tre and Tahzjuan felt uncomfortable at first by their connection to his uncle, they were one of the first duos to kiss on Season 7.</p><p>The new couple may be moving on from Tahzjuan's pre-show date, but fans certainly were not ready to let it go. Following the episode, Tre gave viewers what they wanted, and he shared more details about his uncle on Twitter.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tre Cooper's uncle, Anthony Cooper, is a doctor.</h2><p>After Tahzjuan's revelation, many viewers, understandably, had questions about Tre's uncle. A few days after the episode aired, the Atlanta resident posted a photo of his uncle, Anthony, on Twitter.</p><p>"Too busy w work rn to think of a clever way to do this, so I'm just gonna drop this here and dip," he wrote on Aug. 18. "To those who care, meet Uncle Anthony."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Too busy w work rn to think of a clever way to do this, so Iâ€™m just gonna drop this here and dip.

The Bachelorette alum's uncle is a physician and a father, and his page features many selfies (including a few shirtless ones).</p><p>While Anthony has yet to comment on his inclusion in the Bachelor in Paradise premiere, his nephew isn't concerned at all about a potential love triangle for Tahzjuan's heart.</p><p>"This was never a competition, that's my blood," Tre tweeted. "A win for him IS a win for me, and vice versa."</p><p>Though Tahzjuan's link to Anthony may have made things a bit tricky at first for her and Tre, she's now embracing it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Anthony Cooper (@dranthonycooper)</a></p></figure><p>She added "& went on a date with Tre's Uncle" to her Instagram bio.

Source: TLCAmy Slaton has a husband, a baby, and a full life that sometimes doesn't include her sister, Tammy Slaton. And, it seems, Tammy often worries that Amy could leave her behind. Recently, Amy made it clear she wants to devote less of her time to Tammy and more to her little family."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And, it seems, Tammy often worries that Amy could leave her behind. Recently, Amy made it clear she wants to devote less of her time to Tammy and more to her little family.</p><p>Luckily, Tammy has other things going on outside of the show and outside of her relationship with her sister.</p><p>Viewers often see Tammy make YouTube videos on <a href=#>1000-lb Sisters</a>. She even gets frustrated when her videos are interrupted or when Amy doesn't take it seriously. While it's unclear if Tammy actually makes money from her sporadic YouTube videos, it's a whole *thing* for her and fans want to know where to get their Tammy fix between episodes.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Tammy Slaton's YouTube?</h2><p>Maybe Tammy's attachment to YouTube comes from being unable to leave home without the help of one of her siblings. Or, she likes the attention from fans thanks to 1000-lb Sisters. Either way, YouTube provides a window to the rest of the world that Tammy can't quite access otherwise. And on 1000-lb Sisters, she's often shown making and uploading videos.</p><p>Tammy's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">channel</a> has more than 100,000 subscribers and her videos include home movies with her sister and other family members, along with spicy and sour food challenges. But Tammy might also help run Amy's YouTube channel and it may be the account she refers to in the show.</p><p>According to the information on Amy's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> account, it's used for Amy, Amy's husband Michael Halterman, Tammy, and their brother Chris Combs.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tammy Slaton is also on Cameo.</h2><p>Like her sister, Tammy has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cameo</a> account too. She isn't accepting video requests right now, but so far she has made dozens of videos for her fans. It's another way for her to connect with them, much like YouTube. And thanks to 1000-lb Sisters, Tammy has plenty of people who are interested in learning more about her outside of the show.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Tammy from '1000-lb Sisters' dating now?</h2><p>When Tammy isn't making a YouTube video or yelling at Amy for interrupting one, she's meeting new guys. Well, sort of. She introduced her now-ex-boyfriend <a href=#>Jerry Sykes</a> in Season 2 of 1000-lb Sisters. And in a Season 3 preview, it looks like Tammy brings another new guy into the picture. But because her family is worried that he might take advantage of her or use her for a fetish, they're on high alert.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tammy has to realize that her ‘boyfriends’ are men w/fetishes for big women. She puts too much store in them thinking they care about her but they R destructive relationships! She is co-depending on them but thinking it’s love. She needs to concentrate on herself! <a href=#>#1000lbSisters</a></p>— mary french (@ukgirlinsf) <a href=#>November 19, 2021</a></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, Tammy shared an Instagram post in May 2021 featuring a new boyfriend who calls himself the BBW King. He even has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> account with the same handle. And he shared a video on the platform in which he referred to Tammy as his "soulmate." It's hard to say if the BBW King and Tammy are still together, but chances are, it will play out on the show.</p><p>Watch 1000-lb Sisters on Mondays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmaskaK6unnSpZitp55ixrDB066Zng%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

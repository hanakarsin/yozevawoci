Kodak was first charged with rape, but he pleaded guilty to first-degree assault in a plea deal. According to media reports, Kodak won’t have to serve prison time as long as he completes 18 months of probation.</p><p>Per TMZ, it’s unclear how Saturday’s arrest will affect his supervised release.</p><p><strong>If you need support, The National Sexual Assault Hotline is available 24/7 at 1-800-656-4673.

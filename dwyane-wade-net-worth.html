Thanks to almost 20 years in the NBA, Dwyane Wade has more money than he'll likely ever need. The former star of the Miami Heat led his team to three championships during his years on the team, and finished his career as the Heat's leader in everything from points to steals."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That money comes largely from his career as a basketball player, and from subsequent investments that he has made since the end of his career. Over the course of his career, Dwyane earned $198 million from his basketball contracts alone, a number that may seem modest in the league today, but was staggering at the time.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p class="sc-ktvXtq dPyThM"><span>Dwyane Wade</span></p><p class="sc-fxFQrc gpgOkp">Former professional basketball player</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $170 Million</p><p style=text-align:start>Dwyane Wade is a former professional basketball player.

"So when we moved to (Los Angeles) my wife said 'I got half on it you will never say 'my house' again â€” you can say that in the arena!'"</p><p>In truth, the couple only split a few things 50/50, including the house and expenses for their youngest daughter, Kaavia.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=fr dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@DwyaneWade</a> on <a href=#>@itsgabrielleu</a>'s 50/50 comment:</p><p>ðŸŽ§: <a href=#>https://t.co/dDboeIARV8</a><br>ðŸ“º: <a href=#>https://t.co/zEUh0BRelM</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CI8isyRHZZ</a></p>â€” Club Shay Shay (@ClubShayShay) <a href=#>June 12, 2023</a></figure><p>"We decided that certain pieces of our life, we would share in it," he explained. He added that there are still plenty of pieces of their lives that the couple handles separately, including Dwyane's kids that he doesn't share with Gabrielle, and a variety of other expenses related to their family lives.</p><p>The idea that the couple splits things set off a heated debate on Twitter as many began to discuss the best way to handle finances as a couple. Of course, given Dwyane's sizable net worth, his money management decisions don't look the same as those of many regular Americans. When you earn a couple of NBA championships, your financial picture starts to look pretty rosy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmcS6rc2eZLCZlJp6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

In a competitive game like Fortnite, having a Ranked option seems like a no-brainer. The feature was rolled out in mid-May 2023 for both Battle Royale and Zero Build modes in the game. Players can now receive online rankings and can climb new leaderboards through a series of eight ranks."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The game has reportedly been crashing for several players following the major update.</p><p>As such, Epic Games elected to disable Ranked mode until the issues can be resolved. On June 20, they released some statements on the official <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortnite Status Twitter</a>.</p><p>"We've temporarily disabled Ranked Battle Royale and Ranked Zero Build while we investigate a crashing issue," the team tweeted. "We'll provide an update when Ranked is available again."</p><p>As of this writing, the issues seem to persist and the team continues to investigate the crashes in these modes. Epic Games is also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">addressing</a> "an error with [players' ranks] not matching tournament requirements."</p><p>It's currently unclear when Ranked mode will be back up and ready to go in Fortnite, but the fastest way to get updates on the situation is to check the Fortnite Status Twitter, as its return will likely be announced there first.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSrmZ6gsqV5yKdkn6eiqbuqwMQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

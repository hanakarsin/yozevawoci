Learn more here.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@whitneywaythore</span></figure><p>Ever since <a href=#>My Big Fat Fabulous Life</a> premiered on TLC viewers have been learning intimate details about <a href=#>Whitney Thore</a>'s life. She has shared everything from her romantic relationships, to her various business endeavors, to her weight and infertility struggles. What some fans might not know is that Whitney has a health condition affecting nearly all areas of her life.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at what she's revealed about it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What health condition does Whitney Thore have?</h2><p>Whitney has a health condition called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It happens when the ovaries produce an abnormal amount of male sex hormones called androgens, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johns Hopkins Medicine</a>. Oftentimes — but not always — PCOS is accompanied by cysts on the ovaries. Symptoms can include weight gain, thinning hair on the head, excessive body hair, irregular periods, infertility, and acne, among others.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@whitneywaythore</span></figure><p>As for Whitney, she's known she's had PCOS since she was a young adult. She experienced a 100-pound weight gain, significant hair loss, and facial hair growth.</p><p>"When I first got diagnosed with PCOS at age 23, I had never even heard of [the condition]," Whitney told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redbook </a>magazine. "Now, talking to other women with PCOS, that seems to be a common theme, and it's kind of shocking that so few of us have any idea it exists when it affects about one in every 10 women."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Whitney has been open about her struggles with PCOS.</h2><p>On MBFFL, Whitney has been transparent about living with PCOS. Thinning hair on her head is one of the symptoms she is self-conscious about, and she addressed it by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">allowing cameras into the salon</a> when she needed her weave replaced.</p><p>"My hair has been thinning for about 10 years now," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Whitney explained on the show</a>. "... To be fat is one thing. And I've come to terms with that, which is kind of surprising that I have not really come to terms with maybe not having hair. But I would contend that it's even more difficult for a woman to be bald than it is for a woman to be fat."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Whitney, 38, has also <a href=#>started the process of IVF</a> due to a combination of her age and the fact that she doesn't have a regular period. She already underwent an egg retrieval with the goal of one day creating embryos to implant into a gestational carrier.</p><p>Although Whitney's friend Heather initially said she would carry future Whitney's baby, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heather's doctor said she wasn't an ideal candidate</a>. It's unclear how/when Whitney wants to move forward in the process at this point.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by TLC (@tlc)</a></p></figure><p>Clearly, Whitney's health condition has affected many different areas of her life through the years. But by sharing her experience with PCOS, the MBFFL star is shedding a light on an affliction that millions of women live with in the U.S. And hopefully, they will see a bit of their journey in her story.</p><p>Catch new episodes of My Big Fat Fabulous Life Tuesdays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC, or on the Discovery Plus app.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWqwM2esGasmKS%2FpnnMnpuim5GheqS7zZ2graGfow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

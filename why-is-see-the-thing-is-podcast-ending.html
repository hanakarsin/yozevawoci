Hosts listed “creative differences” as one of the reasons.</h2><p>On Monday, Feb. 19, 2024, Mandii and Bridget revealed on Instagram and X that their podcast, See the Thing Is.., would end after distributing episodes twice weekly for three years. The hosts released a joint statement on their respective accounts underneath a photo of them on stage from one of their live shows.</p><p>“After an incredible journey filled with laughter, tears, and unforgettable moments, we are sad to announce that the See, the Thing Is... podcast will be coming to an end,” Bridget and Mandii’s statement read. “Over the past three years, we have shared stories, insights, and discussions that have touched the hearts of our listeners in ways we couldn't have imagined.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by “See, The Thing Is Podcast” (@seethethingispod)</a></p></figure><p>Mandii and Bridget further shared in their statement that they decided to end their run while the show was still beloved by its listeners. Although they didn’t dive deep into why they made their “difficult decision,” the statement said they had “creative differences” and were ready to make their dreams happen separately.</p><p>Mandii and Bridget aired their final See the Thing Is… podcast episode together on Feb. 27, 2024. The 1 hour, 39-minute episode allowed both hosts to reflect on their four-year run and their growth as podcasters and businesswomen.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What’s next for ‘See the Thing Is… hosts Mandii B and Bridget Kelly?</h2><p>See The Thing Is.. began in 2020 on rapper-turned-podcaster <a href=#>Joe Budden</a>’s network. Initially, the podcast had three hosts — Mandii, Bridget, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DJ Olivia Dope</a>. However, in 2021, DJ left the podcast, and soon after, Bridget and Mandii opted to leave the network to, as Bridget said to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Radio</a> in 2021, “transcend above and beyond everyone’s expectations.”</p><p>Following the hosts’ announcement that their podcast is ending, Mandii and Bridget are exploring their passions outside of their venture. Bridget, who rose to fame in 2012 with her hit single “Special Delivery,” is still working on music and performing in LA, New York, etc. In April 2024, she married her partner, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheech Hall</a>, at a destination wedding in Jamaica. More on that later.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>As for Mandii, her other popular podcast, Whoreible Decisions, which she launched with her co-host, Weezy, in 2017, is something she intends to continue co-hosting. Additionally, Mandii owns a production studio, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Full Court Studios</a>, and has a podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Period, Sis</a>, where she discusses menstrual and other reproductive issues for people with vaginas.</p><p>In February 2024, two days before announcing the end of See the Thing Is…, Mandii announced via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> that an animated series inspired by Period, Sis would be debuting sometime in 2024.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Mandii and Bridget added more context to their ‘See the Thing Is…’ split and confirmed they're friendship is over.</h2><p>While many See The Thing Is… fans were sad to see the podcast go, it was refreshing to see Bridget and Mandi end the show on their own terms and without any ill feelings. Or, so we thought.</p><p>Shortly after airing their final episode, Mandii appeared on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Morning Hustle</a> and hinted at trouble between her and Bridget. She shared with host <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lore’l</a> that she and Bridget had “nothing to talk about” and said she didn’t approve of the person Bridget was possibly going into business with next.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>Soon after her interview, Bridget responded to Mandii on her friend and journalist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blu Telusma</a>’s podcast, Blucentric. Bridget used the platform to confirm she and Mandii weren’t friends at the time of the podcast’s end. The songstress also said Mandii was never invited to her wedding after Mandii reportedly complained about Bridget not allowing her to bring a plus one.</p><p>Mandii fired back in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram Live post</a>, where she gave examples of how she put more work into the podcast than her co-host, stating Bridget often wanted to pay to get things done that Mandii could’ve taught her how to do.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: X.com/@fullcourtpumps</a></figure><p>The drama between the women escalated on X after reports surfaced that Mandii was taking legal action against Bridget. The Stop reported Mandii accused Bridget of stealing $15,000 from her, forcing her to serve Bridget with court papers on her wedding day in Jamaica.</p><p>Bridget responded to the allegations that she was served on X. She tweeted the rumors were false as she reflected on being involved in another <a href=#>April 2024 feud on social media</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Whew the TL is full of bare f**kery today, so Ima clear this up one time for the one time, since everybody standing on (MY) business😭 Only things that got served at my wedding were looks, dubs, and jerk chicken/rice & peas🗣️</p>— Bridget Kelly (@IamBridgetKelly) <a href=#>April 30, 2024</a></figure><p>“Whew, the TL is full of bare f---ery today, so Ima clear this up one time for the one time since everybody is standing on (MY) business,” Bridget wrote. “Only things that got served at my wedding were looks, dubs, and jerk chicken/rice & peas.”</p><p>See the Thing Is… indeed, chile.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZKydlWLBqbGMrZ%2BippditrR5z6ibnJmjqXqmusOipaA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

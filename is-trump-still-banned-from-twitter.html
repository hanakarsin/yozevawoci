While it‚Äôs clear that he has diehard supporters, some members of the Republican party, as well as other politicians, have turned their backs on him for good. But it hasn't ended there. The primary method for spewing his rhetoric ‚Äî social media ‚Äî was also taken away from Trump.</p><p>Fear that Trump might incite more violence has been a major concern for <a href=#>social media apps</a> including Facebook and Twitter, which quickly removed his account from their platforms. However, since the dust has somewhat settled from the attacks, certain questions are arising.&nbsp;</p><p>Is Trump still banned from Twitter? Does Trump have the green light to return to Facebook?

Not only were users baffled at his ability to tweet recklessly while being the leader of the ‚ÄúFree World,‚Äù Trump also used Twitter to show the very worst of his personality.</p><p>Still, nothing compares to him inciting <a href=#>violence at the Capitol</a>. Trump can be called many things, but his decision to light a fire under the Proud Boys will forever haunt his legacy.&nbsp;</p><p>While many people watched it all unfold in real time ‚Äî especially thanks to social media platforms ‚Äî it was clear that something had to be done. And Twitter wasted no time in stripping Trump of his privileges.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Raise your hand if you want Twitter to keep Donald Trump banned‚ù§ üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>‚Äî Nicole (@Sloths7777) <a href=#>May 5, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Politico</u></a> reports that Twitter permanently suspended Trump‚Äôs account on Jan. 8, 2021.

The other people that you said ‘third force’, there was a time some people named their own political party Mega Political Party.</p><p>“By the end of the day, the Mega Political Party never had a councilor, not to talk of an LG chairman. I want to say with all sense of responsibility that it is wrong.</p><p>“To say that some people who had one way or the other been active participants in one political party or the other, but have failed woefully, coming around to say they are the ones that want to give third force to the country is a laughable idea.</p><p>“I look at the dramatis personae that they were at the so-called Rescue Nigeria Project today. Tell me any of them that has not had any stint in one governance or the other and what has been the record in that regard. An assemblage of failed politicians, either elected or appointed, can’t say that want third force movement for the country.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FsZqumoGLDtHnPnadmmaCYerGt02asraednnqlu82ao51llKq4pnnArauaoJmnwm62xKCYZqeknbKzv4yfmKKklZl6sbvLoquim5mWu7R50p6lmqyVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

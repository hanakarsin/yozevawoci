That signing, which happened in 2020, propelled Enchanting to a new level of fame as a rapper. Since then, she continued to gain a following thanks to her presence on social media.</p><p>In June 2024, though, rumors began circulating that Enchanting had died following a post from her sister that seemed to suggest she was on life support. Just hours after the news broke, though, rapper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CJ Kasino</a> took to Instagram seemingly confirming her death. "They Pulled The Plug Bro This S--t So F--ked Up I Just Knew You was Finna Pull Threw," the rapper wrote on June 11, 2024. So, what exactly happened to Enchanting?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@luvenchanting</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What happened to rapper Enchanting?</h2><p>Enchanting's sister Kayy Jayy started this rumor with a post on Facebook in which she said that Enchanting was placed on life support. Many misunderstood this post, believing it to mean that she was already dead. Kayy then wrote another Facebook post in which she clarified that her sister was still alive, and was currently fighting for her life. She also added that she was in the hospital with her.</p><p>Although Kayy had said that Enchanting was still alive, we don't know exactly what happened to her that led her to be on life support. Sadly, just hours after that update, Kay took to Twitter writing, "I love you girl," followed by a broken heart emoji. Though Kay's post didn't mention her passing, fans immediately interpreted it as such. It was the tribute Gucci Mane's paid to her on June 11 that further confirmed the young rapper's death.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gucci Mane (@laflare1017)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Why was Enchanting on life support?</h2><p>Following the news that Enchanting was on life support (without any clear explanation), both fans and fellow rappers offered their prayers for her.</p><p>“Everybody pray for Enchanting. Pray,” Johnnie Damn D said repeatedly in a video that he seemed to be posting from a hospital.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Enchanting still slid on this song <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/I2y2mSAQ2s</a></p>— bfromthesea (@bfromthesea) <a href=#>June 11, 2024</a></figure><p>Since the news of her passing, though, fans have been flooding the comments sections of posts paying tribute to her. "One of the dopest artist that the world didn’t get to fully appreciate," one person wrote under Gucci Mane's post. Under CJ's tribute, one person commented, "rip enchanting, I really liked her music and was looking forward to hearing more, she had a great voice and cadence."</p><p>Enchanting was just 26 years old, and some have already started to speculate about what happened to her. Until we know more, including details on her cause of death, it's best to respect her and her family's privacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSrmaClsrN5xKeaoZmeqbavsw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

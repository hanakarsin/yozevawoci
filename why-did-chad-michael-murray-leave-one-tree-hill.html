And although he landed a few key roles after that (ahem, Cinderella Story!) fans don't really know why he left the show in the first place.</p><p>So really, <a href=#>why did Chad Michael Murray leave One Tree Hill</a>? Here is everything we know regarding the former teen actor's questionable (and highly controversial) decision.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, why did Chad Michael Murray really leave 'One Tree Hill'?</h2><p>Back in 2009, when the CW announced its cast for OTR Season 7, fans were shocked to see that Chad Michael Murray didn't make the cut... and apparently, it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">largely due to contract negotiations</a>, according to Los Angeles Times. Our beloved Chad wanted a pay raise (which was totally deserved), however, the show apparently wasn't able to deliver.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, a video later surfaced of the actor saying: "They're not bringing me back next year ... because they want to save money... Start blogging and being pissed off."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'One Tree Hill' producers were clearly disappointed, and hoped Chad Michael Murray would come back.</h2><p>Later that year, the series' executive producer, Mark Schwahn, explained to a crowd of raging fans in Paris, France, that Chad and his co-star, Hilarie Burton, were the only actors who didn't choose to sign on because of said negotiations.</p><p>"[Hilarie and Chad] are in negotiations right now and I know they've been offered great things, and hopefully they'll decide to come back. If they don't that's always a possibility...[the show] has made it through some of the riskier moves we've done."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span><p>Hilarie Burton and Chad Michael Murray during Gavin Degraw and Cast Members of "One Tree Hill" Appear at Planet Hollywood - New York at Planet Hollywood in New York City, New York, United States.

He didn't, however, do it for the money â€” the actor said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he purely did it for the show's fans</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"I've been busy with different discoveries in my own life [and] it never really dawned on me... Then the opportunity came, and I knew how important it was to these fans who are everything to the show â€” and that was it," he told TV Guide at the time. Our hero.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chad Michael Murray also may have just implied there's going to be a 'One Tree Hill' reunion.</h2><p>Diehard fans of the show have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speculating about a reunion or some sort of revival</a>, according to BuzzFeed, ever since Chad posted a cryptic photo to Instagram, showing off his Tree Hill Ravens basketball jersey. The caption read, "Working on a little somethin somethin...ðŸ˜‰ #OTH #LucasScott." So maybe the producers came through with a raise?&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, maybe he's just bored, or feeling nostalgic. Aside from playing a crazy cult leader on Riverdale, the 38-year-old Hollywood veteran hasn't been doing too much TV... maybe he's making a scrapbook LOL.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: GIPHY</a></figure><p>We'll never understand why Chad gave up his role as Lucas, but here's to hoping he's reprising the role.

It's only been three months since Jeff Hardy made his debut on the March 9 episode of AEW: Dynamite and his career has already been put on hold. Following a DUI he received in the early hours of June 13, Hardy has been indefinitely suspended from All Elite Wrestling (AEW)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Following a DUI he received in the early hours of June 13, Hardy has been indefinitely suspended from All Elite Wrestling (AEW). Unfortunately, this is not the first time Hardy has found himself behind bars. Here's what we know about the wrestler's arrest record.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Let's take a look at Jeff Hardy's arrest record.</h2><p>Sadly, this is not Hardy's first DUI. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daytona Beach News-Journal</a> reported this was his "third DUI offense within the last 10 years," per the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP). In his home state of North Carolina, Hardy was arrested in 2018 and again 2019. The outlet also referenced his July 2019 arrest for public intoxication.</p><p>The FHP's report stated Hardy was "swerving all over the roadway, failing to maintain (his) lane." The incident occurred on Interstate 4 near Mile Marker 109. Authorities also reported that Hardy didn't immediately pull over when asked.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Florida Department of Corrections</span><p>Jeff Hardy DUI booking</p></figure><p>The report also stated Hardy engaged in two breathalyzer readings. He blew a 0.294 and 0.291 respectively. Beyond <a href=#>the DUI</a>, Hardy was also charged with driving on a suspended license as well as "violating a restriction which required him to have a DUI interlock device in his vehicle." Currently Hardy is in Volusia County Jail on $3,500 bond.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Hardy was visibly impaired when pulled over.</h2><p>When the arresting officer approached the car, they noticed Hardy was "in a stupor and confused." He reached for something in a black backpack next to him, which caused the police to shout "loud, verbal commands to remove his hands from the bag." Hardy was so out of it that the officer had to slap his window in order to get Hardy's attention.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Addiction is a scary thing. Here’s hoping Jeff Hardy is afforded time away from wrestling to get the help he clearly needs</p>— Ross Tweddell (@RossOnRasslin) <a href=#>June 13, 2022</a></figure><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Galigani Law Firm</a>, a third DUI within 10 years of the previous two is considered a third-degree felony. Not only is this punishable by a $5,000 fine (which seems very low), but it can also come with five years in a Florida State Prison. However, all is not lost for his AEW career if Hardy gets his act together.</p><p>In a statement released by CEO Tony Khan he said, "We’ve made it clear to Jeff that we’ll assist him in getting treatment for substance abuse issues, which he has indicated that he’s open to receiving. In the interim, he is suspended without pay, and he can only return to AEW upon successfully completing treatment and maintaining his sobriety."</p><p>Tony also made it very clear that AEW does not condone this type of behavior.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KnsoyhmKucqWKus77ErKtmqpWYvLOw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

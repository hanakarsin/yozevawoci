However, not much more was known about her — until rumors began to fly that Hailey was actually a preschool teacher who was fired from her job because of the interview.</p><p>Is it true?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube/@Tim and dee tv</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Was the "Hawk Tuah" girl actually fired from her job because of her interview?</h2><p>Because the internet is the internet, any gaps in factual information will be quickly filled in by rumors and hoaxes — and this seems to be a perfect example.</p><p>A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">viral post</a> from a Facebook page called the Tippah County Tribune claimed that the "hawk tuah girl" was Hailey Wellington of Ripley, Miss., and that she had been fired from her job as a preschool teacher.</p><p>The post claims that Epstein Day School Director Carla Reed released a statement regarding the incident: “We have kids spitting on each other and everything else since they heard their beloved Miss Hailey say 'spit on that thang' on YouTube. They really look up to her as a role model and imitate the things that she does."</p><p>"We love Hailey but unfortunately we cannot allow this type of behavior from one of our very own faculty members," the post continued.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The post goes on to quote a "response" from Hailey herself: "What I said during that interview was based on my own personal thoughts. I was giving good advice to those who might want to have a little fun. I have the right to share my life experiences if I choose to do so. It has nothing to do with the kind of teacher I am for my kids. It is outright discrimination and I plan to seek retribution against the preschool."</p><p>While the post provides plenty of detail, including the supposed quote from Hailey herself, many readers failed to realize that the "Tippah County Tribune" is a self-proclaimed satire publication. In fact, their header boasts that they're the "county's No. 1 publication for satirical laughs."</p><p>So, no, Hailey is decidedly not a preschool teacher who was fired from a job in from Ripley, Miss.</p><p>In fact, fast-forward to late June, and Hailey actually revealed a little bit about her real occupation.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Hawk Tuah Girl Hailey revealed her real job — and no, she wasn't fired from it.</h2><p>After Hailey showed up on stage as the <a href=#><strong>surprise guest at a Zach Bryan show</strong></a> on June 29, she sat down for an interview with Zach Bryan's longtime girlfriend, influencer <a href=# style=text-align:start><strong>Brianna LaPaglia</strong></a>, for the Plan Bri Uncut podcast.</p><p>Hailey mentioned that after dropping out of school "a year or two ago," she had been working at a spring factory, but had recently quit.

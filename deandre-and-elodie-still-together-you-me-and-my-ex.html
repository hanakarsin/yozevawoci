Elodie's prying questions make Rowan just a tad uncomfortable, which doesn't go over well with De'Andre. You can't help but wonder if De'Andre's girlfriend is going to be the cause for a breakup rather than his ex.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are De'Andre and Elodie still together after 'You, Me & My Ex'?</h2><p>On You, Me & My Ex, Elodie explains that she learned about Rowan and De'Andre's close friendship a few months into dating him. But, because they live in a different state from Rowan, there was never much of a threat. Still, it's hard for Elodie not to totally ignore her concerns when it comes to her boyfriend and his best friend/ex-girlfriend, who also happens to be extremely close to De'Andre's mother.</p><p>Outside of the show, neither De'Andre or Elodie have revealed their relationship status on social media. But zero evidence of their relationship working out could mean that there's a strong possibility that the couple is no more. The clip from the May 22 episode certainly makes it seem like a breakup is possible if De'Andre and Elodie can't find some middle ground regarding his ex.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>"Honestly, I'm over the same f--king questions over and over and over and over again," De'Andre tells producers in the clip, with Elodie at his side. "That's my best friend. I can talk to her about anything."</p><p>When Elodie interrupts to add that she is his best friend, De'Andre clarifies that there's a difference between his friendship with Rowan and his relationship with Elodie.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"No disrespect, but I can find another girl, I can find another chick," he says. "But this is my best friend.

After all, we learned that he totally ghosted Elodie ... during her surgery! During that time, he was totally distracted by Rowan. Obviously, Elodie wasn't happy.</p><p>It isn't clear yet what this may mean for their relationship, but fans are begging Elodie to let him go.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thatâ€™s what deandre getsâ€¦ he has no reason to be tied to his ex the way Elodie does to her ex husbandâ€¦ Now he sees what it feels like when thereâ€™s a genuine reason to have an ex around <a href=#>#YouMeAndMyEx</a></p>â€” MegamindðŸ’‹ (@ashton_h23) <a href=#>June 6, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rowan insists that she and De'Andre are just friends.</h2><p>Early in the You, Me & My Ex clip, Elodie asks Rowan personal questions about how close she really is to De'Andre and it doesn't sit well with Rowan. Rowan explains that she wants Elodie to realize and focus on the fact that she and De'Andre are "just friends."</p><p>And that may still be the case, but Elodie has a hard time coming to terms with this particular friendship in her boyfriend's life.</p><p>Watch You, Me & My Ex on Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbKiusOrnGaZnpl6prjOnaCeZaOptq24jK2moJ2knbKzediorGallWKur7CMprBmnag%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

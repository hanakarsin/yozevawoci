For the avoidance of doubt, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, is the Chairman of the Campaign Council. As a result, Mr President has SPECIFICALLY directed that the Vice-President and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha should be left out of the Campaign Council to concentrate on the governance of the country and administration of Government.</p><p>“As a responsible Party and Government, all the key functionaries of government cannot abandon their positions for electioneering campaigns. The APC has the mandate of the Nigerian people to administer the country on their behalf at least till May, 29, 2023, and this we intend to do with all sense of responsibility.”</p><p>Keyamo said APC will not at this moment toe the path of those who governed the country in an irresponsible manner.</p><p>He boasted that the ruling party is not in total disarray like those claiming they want to ‘rescue’ the country, “but cannot simply manage their own internal affairs.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FtZpuqlZa4qrrGZpmuoJGntm7AzqWbZq2jYruwwIytpmahnpi5trDEZqasoZ6Xrqu7jKKlZqyZo8KjwdJmmpqloJa2qLqMnKauppOeuW6tz5xm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

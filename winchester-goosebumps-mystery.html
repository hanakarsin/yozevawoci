Source: TwitterThe Winchester Mystery House was built in San Jose by Sarah Winchester, the widow of Will Winchester (who worked in her father-in-law Oliver Winchester's gun business). Sarah inherited a fortune from the gun manufacturing company run by the men in her family. She was convinced after her husband's death by an occultist that the spirits of people killed by her husband's guns were trying to get to her, and that the only way to keep them at bay was to continually have work done on her house."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This sounds like a completely fictional story, we know, but it's not. It's truly one of the weird creepy stories of our time.&nbsp;</p><p>It is, however, being turned into a movie starring Helen Mirren, because it's just that good.

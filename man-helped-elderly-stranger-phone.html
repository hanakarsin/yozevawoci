Source: iStock Photo / TwitterHave you ever tried helping an old person figure out technology? It's not easy. Anyone who does it regularly is a saint. So is the guy who got a wrong number call from an elderly man in need of some assistance figuring out his phone.
A Twitter user, @LosFreaklander, who goes by Tim, wrote a thread about an adventure he went on thanks to a wrong number call from an elderly stranger who was struggling."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It's not easy. Anyone who does it regularly is a saint. So is the guy who got a wrong number call from an elderly man in need of some assistance figuring out his phone.</p><p>A Twitter user, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@LosFreaklander</a>, who goes by Tim, wrote a thread about an adventure he went on thanks to a wrong number call from an elderly stranger who was struggling. He did the right thing by helping out this old man, and now he's got a story for life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>An older man called him looking for his son Bobby. He didn't really give Tim a chance to say, "Hey, this is a wrong number, sorry man." He just started talking. So Tim started listening.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Raise your hand if you are a young-ish person who has had to try to convince the older people in your life to stay home during the pandemic, even if they think it's important to go out. Yeah. Most of us have.&nbsp;</p><p>Now raise your hand if you are a young-ish person who has had to listen to an older person you know go on and on about how nothing works with their phone or computer, and you just know it's fine but that they don't have any clue what they're doing.&nbsp;</p><p>This happens all the time with my grandma. And now it's happening with Bobby's dad. But Tim was patient and kind to this old man.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Tim had a lot of sympathy for Bobby, who'd clearly been dealing with his father's frustrating antics this whole time. And his father was upset because he couldn't reach him. So he entertained the conversation and decided to help the guy out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Obviously, it didn't help the situation that the old man was hard of hearing. It's got to be frustrating for everyone involved when a professional is trying to explain something to someone who doesn't understand and also can't hear them.&nbsp;</p><p>So Tim did the honorable thing and helped him call AT&T. I guess they got the AT&T rep on a conference call because both of them walked the old man through what he had to do to move his SIM card from his old phone into his new one.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>It took more than half an hour to fix that simple issue, but Bobby's father was grateful for the help and offered to buy Tim dinner and drinks when the pandemic is over.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Tim didn't mince words. He told Bobby's dad that when he gets in touch with his son, he should tell him he's the one who owes Tim a drink. Luckily, Bobby's dad seemed to have a sense of humor about it. And that's the whole story! But there is one extra detail that Tim wanted to share with everyone...</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>So there you have it, folks. Tim, out of the kindness of his heart, may have facilitated an old man posting fake news all over his Facebook page day in and day out. Maybe not. But I feel like that's all old people on Facebook do.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, it's heartwarming that he was willing to take the time to help out this man who clearly needed it. I bet both Bobby's dad and Bobby are grateful for this stranger today.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6veceeo6mdlGKyrbDEq6OyZaOpv6K6xp6pZqiYpLum</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

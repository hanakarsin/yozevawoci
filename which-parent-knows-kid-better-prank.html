I'm jealous, I'm not even gonna lie, like I don't care about Christmases or Thanksgivings, graduations, I wish I was able to prank, I wish I was able to f--- with them."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @moseschafles</span></figure><p>Several people commented on Moses's video that they, too, wish they could do the same thing with their parents: "I’m 42. Parents divorced since I was 7 and I feel the exact same way!!!"</p><p>"My parents were never married / together. I feel the same way!" another person remarked, to which someone else responded: "I literally just tweeted something like this, I haven’t even seen a AA family do this prank yet."</p><p>In Ava's original video, which she posted under her TikTok handle @an1cole33, Ava starts off with some softball questions. Her father sells that he doesn't know the answers beforehand pretty well, stating that he doesn't want to play the game.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@an1cole33 href=#>@an1cole33</a><p>this is too much</p><a title="♬ original sound - an1cole33" href=#>♬ original sound - an1cole33</a></figure><p>Her mother, however, seems ready to jump into the action. She first asks what her favorite color is and without hesitation her dad says, "Light pink."</p><p>Mom says that she would've "picked blue" despite the fact that Ava told her her entire room is covered in light pink. When she asks what her favorite dessert is, Mom and Dad say the correct answer at the same time: "crème brûlée."</p><p>Ava then talks to someone off camera to "keep track" of who is getting more answers correctly, "Dad 2, Mom 1," she says to the official score keeper.</p><p>When she asks what her favorite movie is, Dad, again, provides the right answer, stating that it's Just Go With It, which he remarks she's seen a ton of times.</p><p>It's at this point in the games Mom starts to seem a bit perplexed, and while her and Dad say that they know the sorority she goes to, Dad concedes to give it to her. When Ava asks what her favorite store to shop at is, Dad replies with "Online boutiques," while mom says <a href=#>Lululemon</a>. Ava tells her mom that Dad's right again and while Mom looks at him in protest he simply says he sees that his card has been charged by the store countless times.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @an1cole33</span></figure><p>When she asks what her favorite show is, her mother swears it's <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> while her dad mistakenly says Just Go With It again, while correcting himself on the TV show and rattling off Real Housewives of New Jersey.</p><p>Ava's mom was stunned, yet again, by Dad's correct response.</p><p>"Who's my favorite housewife?" she asks next and while Mom ruminates, Dad immediately answers, "<a href=#>Margaret Josephs</a>." Ava laughs, playing it off like she can't believe Dad was so on the money.</p><p>It's at this point that her mom starts to question whether or not she's being set up and is stunned that her husband even knows who Margaret Josephs is: "Is this a game? Is this bulls---?"</p><p>She then goes to ask about her favorite country singer and Mom incorrectly guesses <a href=#>Morgan Wallen</a>, while Dad gets it right with <a href=#>Zach Bryan</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @an1cole33</span></figure><p>Mom can't believe it, telling Dad that he doesn't "know anything about her," as the game continues. Ava asks what her favorite coffee shop is and mom incorrectly says Starbucks, but Dad gets it right again: "Turbo Coffee in Alabama."</p><p>When she asks about her favorite scent, Mom starts to get it right, but then Dad completes the rest.</p><p>It's at this point that Mom is completely convinced something fishy is going on, but then Dad replies that he would be unable to remember "10-12 things" before going on camera.</p><p>"That's true, actually," she says before Ava asks what her dream dog is. Dad, smiling, turns around and says, "Golden retriever."</p><p>Mom seems really upset at this point, covering her face up as Dad goes to comfort her. Mom then demands to be given one that she would know. Ava asks who her favorite YouTuber would be. He takes his time answering, murmuring to himself, "Oh I know this."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @an1cole33</span></figure><p>Mom immediately snaps that there's no way he would know who it is. "If you f------ know this one then I'm gonna be done," she warns, looking at her husband.</p><p>"Alicia ... Alicia Marie," he says as his daughter smiles and says, "yes!" Dad remarks that he recalls seeing her watch her videos.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWqr8dmp5qqlaPBbrfNqK6sZZuesW6uxK2rnqpdpb%2Biuso%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

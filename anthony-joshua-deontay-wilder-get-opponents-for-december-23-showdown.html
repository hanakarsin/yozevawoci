That same night, Deontay Wilder and Joseph Parker are scheduled to square off. On that date in Riyadh, Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk were scheduled to square off in their historic undisputed heavyweight title fight.
But that date has been rescheduled for February 2024 following Fury’s brutal night against Francis Ngannou in October.
The Saudi boxing authorities have made up their minds that the show will go on, and they are putting together a fantastic evening of boxing for that night right before Christmas."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In his 28 professional fights, the Swedish southpaw’s lone defeat came against Fury in 2019.</p><p>Wallin gave a fantastic performance that night. He used a precisely timed right hand to open a large cut above Fury’s eye before he lost a decision.</p><p>In the co-main event, Parker would fight Wilder. The American fighter has only engaged in a bout once in the previous two years.</p><p>On the other hand, in 2023, Parker has won three straight fights.

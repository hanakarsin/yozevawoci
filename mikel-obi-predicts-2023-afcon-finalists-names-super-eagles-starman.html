I was thinking about it the other day and I was thinking that we managed to beat them in the group stage and they were on the verge of leaving the tournament, and all of a sudden you know, they are back in it, and now.</p><p>“They have got a wind with them and now are playing prettily okay but not so well, but they have started to win games, and now if they can manage to get to the final, who knows?”</p><p>Meanwhile, Mikel Obi has noted that Super Eagles goalkeeper, Stanley Nwabali has become the talk of the Nigerian team.</p><p>Stanley Nwabali was expected to be the backup goalkeeper to Francis Uzoho but ended up becoming Jose Peseiro’s favourite at the 2023 AFCON.</p><p>In five games, Nwabali has conceded just a goal and recorded four clean sheets which makes him one of the best goalkeepers in the tournament.</p><p>“When you look through the whole team everybody has been absolutely superb, starting from the goalkeeper which is something I talked about before the tournament. I said one position we need to make sure we sort out is the goalkeeping position and we’ve managed to do that,” Mikel Obi said.</p><p>“He’s based in Africa and he’s managed to become the talk of the tournament, he’s become one of the favourites for the Nigerian fans. He’s put in very good performances.</p><p>“Before we scored the goal against Angola, there was a massive save that he made. If the ball went in, it would have been a different ball game.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze49uZqahm5q5brvBomSpqpWZtqTA0mZpaWpjYq6nr86nZJ%2Bhnpa5qr%2FTrGSnmZ2awG6%2F1Kmcq2WVlrStsdJmqq2ZoqKur3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

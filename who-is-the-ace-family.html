But none of those internet celebs have as many subscribers as The ACE Family."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Meet the YouTube clan who has over 17 million subscribers. Everything we know about the family.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Even if you don't spend any time on YouTube, you may have heard of popular influencers like David Dobrik, Jeffree Star, and James Charles because they’ve all launched various projects outside of their channels on the video-sharing site. But none of those internet celebs have as many subscribers as <a href=#>The ACE Family.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is The ACE Family?</h2><p>The clan’s brand name comes from its members’ first initials: dad Austin McBroom, mom Catherine Paiz, and daughter Elle (baby Alaïa came later). The couple started posting videos about their day-to-day lives just a few months before their first child was born in 2016. They now have over 17.3 million followers on the platform.</p><p>Despite their crazy success as content creators, Catherine admitted that the pair doesn’t view themselves as famous. "It's crazy how fast we grew… I wouldn't say we're celebs, but… I mean, yeah, the fans see us like that."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The attractive duo, who welcomed second daughter Alaïa in October 2018, document everything, from fun times as a family of four to pranks the young parents pull on each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Their collection of videos has racked up nearly 3 billion views and Catherine told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Power 106 Los Angeles</a> that they’re never stressed about filming new ones. "It's not pressure because it comes so natural to us," she explained. "It's work, but it's not really work because we're being ourselves."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did The ACE Family get rich?</h2><p>A majority of the couple’s income comes from their YouTube videos. Various reports estimate that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Austin’s net worth</a> is around $5 million thanks, in part, to his days as a college basketball player, which made him a social media star at a young age.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Catherine’s net worth is thought to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">much lower at $750,000</a> despite having 600,000 more followers than Austin <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Instagram</a>. There may be conflicting numbers floating around the internet in regards to their salaries, but the influencers are definitely not strapped for cash.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some publications state</a> that the pair’s combined net worth could be closer to $13 million, which would explain how they were able to purchase a property for $10 million in Los Angeles. Catherine and Austin told fans back in March that they were merging two recently built mansions into one giant home.</p><p>A few fans immediately criticized the size of the new pad. "Just so you guys know, I feel like a lot of people are always like, 'Oh, why do they need such a big house,' but to be honest with you, we have so many people that stay with us all the time," Catherine told haters.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>"We do also plan on expanding our family, our family is going to get a lot bigger. This house is definitely needed for what we plan on doing with our career, what we plan on doing with our lives," she added. "This is our sanctuary, this is our empire. This is where we are going to be for 15, 20 years."</p><p>Though the duo certainly likes to spend the money they’ve made, they’re also charitable. On June 29, Austin and Catherine held their annual celebrity basketball tournament at the Staples Center, which raises money for different philanthropies.</p><p>We love famous people who love to help the less fortunate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZK2glWKupLGMn5imoZyu</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

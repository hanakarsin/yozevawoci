We must be vigilant and ready to challenge all actions which threaten to relegate our collective interest to the background.</p><p>“In the same vein, we must be wary of the antics of the cunning and deceitful who may wish to exploit the challenges to advance their destructive designs.</p><p>“In as much as we encourage full participation of Christians in politics, our involvement must not be used to create disaffection among the various ethnic and religious groups in the country. We must resist the attempts by some elements to use religion to perpetuate the crisis.</p><p>“Christians are yet to come together to elect representatives who must vie for political offices. Any individual aspiring to serve in any capacity should project his or her strength of character rather than hide under an omnibus but clearly dubious forum to appropriate our collective rights for personal consideration.</p><p>“The recent debate on representation on account of faith is most unnecessary. Competence and integrity should be the criteria for representation.</p><p>“All those who do not wish to be ruled by persons of dubious character should endeavour to be active in the days ahead. Let all those with their PVCs vote for candidates of their choice. All candidates should be put to the strictest proof of their claims.</p><p>“Anyone who exhibits any shred of doubt should be rejected roundly. The antecedents of prominent candidates in the forthcoming presidential elections, and even all elections, should be evidence of capacity. The manifesto belongs, largely, to the party,’’ Akeredolu submitted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5JpZqato6G2rnnMrqqloZ1iwaqvyp6rZpmbmr%2BmsM6lrGaslaG5tHnNop6eqpmWu7R506hkr6ekmnqjrdKem2annmKwsLnPnqueppOaeqK6w2agp6yVnL%2BqwNhmpaisXaeyrbXGoqanZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

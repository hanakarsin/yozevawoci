While security agencies moved swiftly to contain the violence around Gora Gan and adjoining villages, there was the mobilization of Atyap youths by some ethnic chauvinists among the Atyap ethnic community and other non-peace loving organizations that resulted in attacks on Fulani settlements throughout the Chiefdom.</p><p>“Within a few days, all the houses of the Fulani in the Chiefdom were burnt by mobs in broad daylight. In addition to the burning of settlements, an unconfirmed number of Fulani pastoralists were also killed. As a consequence, the surviving victims of the arson are now internally displaced and scattered around in neighbouring Local Governments of Kaura, Kauru, Lere, Jema’a and Kachia.</p><p>“Due to the nature of attacks and displacement of the Fulani people, we are yet to ascertain the total number of people killed, even though there are confirmed reports of the killing of 16 persons, mostly women and children. Over 300 houses belonging to the Fulani are reportedly burnt to ashes in the different villages for the Chiefdom.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5BwZrCdXZa%2FpnnApaqoZaaesLW1zKxkqJ5dl66vsMitqmabkanBrbGMq6ysrJyav7R5zKKwnqyknnqiuMuan2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

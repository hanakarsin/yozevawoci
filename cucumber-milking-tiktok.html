And while they're often undeniably ingenious (ahem, every single one of <a href=#>these makeup hacks</a>), one recent fad called "cucumber milking" is truly making all of us uncomfortable.</p><p>If you aren't already familiar with the nasty trend that is "cucumber milking," get ready to be totally and utterly grossed out with the internet... after watching one (or 10) of these mesmerizing-yet-disgusting videos, you really can't unsee it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: GIPHY</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is "cucumber milking" on TikTok and why are people doing it?</h2><p>While cucumbers don't actually contain milk (shocker!), they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">contain a white substance called cucurbitacin</a>, which can add a less-than-ideal bitter taste to your beloved cuke, according to Delish. Those who are looking to get a sweeter taste from their cucumber can essentially "milk" the cucurbitacin right out of the cucumber, which sounds gross but apparently can work wonders.&nbsp;</p><p>It all started when TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@basicallyperkfect</a> spread her sister-in-law's "cooking secret." Basicallyperkfect chops off the edge of the cucumber, and rubs it against the other cucumber slices until a white, milky substance comes out. The result? A reportedly "fresh" and juicy" flavor. It sounds lovely, but truth be told, the process is a little gross. Check out her original video below.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@basicallyperkfect href=#>@basicallyperkfect</a><p>milking a cucumber?<a title=healthheroes href=#>##healthheroes</a> <a title=kitchenhacks href=#>##kitchenhacks</a> <a title=cucumber href=#>##cucumber</a> <a title=fyp href=#>##fyp</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - basicallyperkfect" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - basicallyperkfect</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some on Twitter are straight-up grossed out by the concept of "milking cucumbers."</h2><p>Understandably, not everyone is thrilled about the concept of this trend ‚Äî a large portion of the Twitterverse is simply grossed out by the phrase "cucumber milking" while others are put off by the sight of a white, cheese-like substance coming out of the beloved vegetable.

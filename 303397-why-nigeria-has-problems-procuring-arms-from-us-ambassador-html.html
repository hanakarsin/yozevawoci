Some alleged&nbsp;that the money could be used&nbsp;for arms smuggling and wondered why the government did not follow the procedure if the deal was legitimate.</p><p>According to one of the previous reports exclusively referring to <a href=#>the multiple military and administrative officials of Nigeria, the country had to adopt&nbsp;subterranean strategy</a> to procure arms after the American government&nbsp;blocked orders placed by Nigeria for arms and ammunition.</p><p>Many Nigerians started accusing the US side of blocking the legal ways of procuring arms aimed at&nbsp;fighting Boko Haram, American authorities went public with another explanation providing that the situation&nbsp;had nothing to do with the alleged plot against Nigerians.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>$5.7M: FG Threatens South Africa</a></p><p>The American Ambassador to Nigeria, James Entwistle, was quoted saying by&nbsp;Premium Times in the recent interview:</p><p><i>"Before we share equipment with any country, whether it is a government to government grant or a commercial sale that requires government approval, we look at a couple of things. Does it make sense in terms of that country’s needs? The second thing we look at is the human rights situation in that country. And as we look at equipment transfers, we look at the situation in those countries in the past few years. And as you all know, there have been instances (I’m not saying across the board) of human rights abuses by the Nigerian military in the North-East.</i></p><p><i>"So the kind of question that we have to ask is let’s say we give certain kinds of equipment to Nigerian military that is then used in a way that affects human situation. If I approve that, I’m responsible for that. We take that responsibility very seriously."</i></p><p>The ambassador insisted however that the two countries continued collaboration in terms of training and equipment, debunking the opposite claims.</p><p><i>"Some of the newest vessels in your navy came from the United States. So the idea that the United States does not share equipment with Nigeria across the board is untrue."</i></p><p>Entwistle also reinstated the&nbsp;US&nbsp;support for Nigeria in fight against insurgency in the North-East.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>$9.3m Private Jet: Source Reveals Pastor Oritsejafor’s Involvement</a></p><p><i>"I had the honour of sitting down and talking to him (President Jonathan). And the first thing I said to him is ‘Mr. President, I want to be very clear, the United States stands with Nigeria on the war on terror’."</i></p><p>Speaking about the importance of multi-directional approach towards the fight, the ambassador pointed out that Nigeria should not only purchase hi-tech equipment but also mind the&nbsp;welfare of its troops even more seriously.</p><p><i>"I would say as we support the military in the struggle against Boko Haram, obviously equipment is part of the equation but I think it’s more than that. It bothers me when I talk to soldiers in the North-East and they say they are in the frontline with only a few bullets. I think what’s more important is the basic needs of soldiers on the field, making sure … they are well trained and they have ammunition for their rifles. If you don’t focus on taking care of welfare of soldiers on the ground, buying hi-tech equipment does not solve anything."</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHF%2FknJuZq%2BYrnqvtcaeqaKZXZ2utHnPq6abpJWiwG680aiarqqZo7RurdGmqmaeoqS6bsHSZpimmpGowKKwzqtloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

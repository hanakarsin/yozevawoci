Source: LifetimeAs of late, Lifetime has been putting a lot of focus on its Ripped From the Headlines series, and that momentum isn't stopping anytime soon. Their latest movie, Girl in the Basement, is a hair-raising tale of a diabolical father who imprisons his daughter in their basement for a quarter-century."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Lifetime's take on the harrowing abduction case is a true hair-raiser, but is it based in fact?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span></figure><p>As of late, Lifetime has been putting a lot of focus on its Ripped From the Headlines series, and that momentum isn't stopping anytime soon. Their latest movie, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Girl in the Basement</a>, is a hair-raising tale of a diabolical father who imprisons his daughter in their basement for a quarter-century.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the events that happen within Lifetime's films are often somewhat dramatized, at its core, is Girl in the Basement a real story? And if so, what exactly is that story? Here's a breakdown of all the known details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: lifetime</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Despite television dramatization, the real story behind 'Girl in the Basement' is as chilling as can be.</h2><p>Lifetime’s&nbsp;Girl in the Basement&nbsp;focuses on the tragic story of Sara (played by Stefanie Scott), who is taken captive in their family basement by her father, Don (Judd Nelson). Despite lying to his wife, Irene (Joely Fisher), and claiming that Sara ran away, he holds her captive in the basement for the next two decades, torturing and sexually assaulting her.</p><p>Sara gives birth to several children along the way, a snag for Don. To work through this, he takes their youngest up to Irene to raise together, convincing her that Sara sent the baby from wherever she ran off to.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span></figure><p>Eventually, Sara is able to escape and she takes to the press with her story. The film closes on her family having to come to terms with what Don has covertly perpetrated over the years. The wild part of all of this? Lifetime's depiction isn't even that far off at all from what actually went down.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The true story the movie is based on is just as twisted.</h2><p>Based on the true story of Elisabeth Fritzl, Girl in the Basement offers a take on the young Austrian's tragic struggle to escape captivity. As reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxygen</a>, Elisabeth was held captive by her father from 1984 to 2008, after being drugged with ether and handcuffed in their basement.&nbsp;</p><p>He forced the young girl to write a letter to her mother saying she ran away to cover her tracks. On top of it all, he proceeded to sexually assault her almost every day, which left her pregnant seven times.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>On August 28, 1984, 18-year-old Elisabeth Fritzl was held prisoner by her father in a secret chamber inside a basement where he raped her repeatedly for 24 years.</p><p>After giving birth to seven of her father's children, she managed to get out of the chamber in 2008. <a href=#>#HistoryVille</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/BVJvDzAYXQ</a></p>— H i s t o r y V i l l e (@HistoryVille) <a href=#>June 27, 2020</a></figure><p>Just as in the film rendition, Elisabeth's father attempted to raise the children upstairs with his wife, claiming their daughter had sent the babies to be cared for. Things remained like this for a while, until April 19, 2008. When Elisabeth's eldest child lost consciousness in the basement, she finally emerged to take her to the hospital. This public outing raised questions and soon enough the entire situation was brought to light.</p><p>Nowadays, Elisabeth has changed her name and relocated to an unidentified small town in Austria with her children, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirror</a>. Overcoming the trauma those years brought on has understandably been a lot for her. Now, their new home is seemingly under security, and she has even reportedly moved on romantically with a longtime bodyguard.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLazuIyipWasmJp6o63SnqSepqRiv6aty2aqraeirg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Students are also advised to use safe means of transportation to their respective safer destinations.”</p><p>The school also appealled that a joint patrol team of armed soldiers and other law enforcement agencies should beef up security and ensure that students are adequately protected as they evacuate their hostels to safe destinations.</p><p>“Students are to note that adequate notice will be given to them when normalcy is fully restored in Jos and environs to enable them to return for the completion of their second-semester examinations and other academic activities,” the school added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5FpZpuqlZa4qrrGZqynoZqkwG6%2F1KynnqaUqHqir8CdnKahk2KupMDIr6CtoZWoeqq6w56doqaZqbKtxYyorZ6qXZ67tLHCrqmirKlk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

This is someone you do not even know! Common!</p><p>“You have no single fact/evidence but will sit behind your phones and make a smooth video defaming my personality. Why?</p><p>“When I was plus size, it was the height of body shaming, now on my fitness journey, same negative comments, when I made my political choice, the same negatives. Guys, let people live their lives and respect them for it. Some of us have muscle to keep it going, how about those that can’t and silently struggle with depression and low self-esteem?</p><p>“We celebrities are human, we have blood running through our veins like you. No one judges your choice or approach to life in your corner, so why judge on personal and human actions?</p><p>“More often than not, I ignore these comments or don’t even bother reading them but sometimes, it hits badly and you truly and really want to set an example.</p><p>“I am aware that defamation is a serious matter and can have severe consequences both legally and socially. It is essential to recognize the impact of our words on others and the responsibilities that come with expressing our opinions publicly. While freedom of speech is a fundamental right, I think it should be exercised responsibly and with consideration for the potential harm it may cause.

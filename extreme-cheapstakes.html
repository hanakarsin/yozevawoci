They'll try to stiff you for the most trivial things, to the point where it's almost like they don't realize you need to pay your rent and eat food in order to be able to produce good work. For them.&nbsp;</p><p>And if, God forbid, your career relates to art in any way — whether you're an illustrator, painter, graphic designer, or writer, even — well then, you've really got the worst end of the stick. I'm not sure if people think that all artists are rich and don't have anything better to do with their time than make free designs and logos for clients, but that's certainly how it's come to seem.</p><p>It's a really gross practice that has metastasized over the past few years with freelancing becoming more commonplace as a part of the rise of the gig economy. It's become such an issue that New York City had to put a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Freelance Isn't Free" law</a> on the books last year to protect independent contractors.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting financially cheated after putting in time and labor isn't funny, but when there's nothing concrete you can do to help your cause, laughter can be the best medicine.&nbsp;</p><p>Below are some of the most miserly cheapskates everyone needs to avoid at all costs. And we're sure the freelancers among us can relate.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">1. Avoid this person if you're trying to rent out a room in your house.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>What a generous offer of $150 a month for TWO people, since "significant others are allowed to live rent-free," after making ludicrous demands of your roommates. I don't know where this person is, but as a New York native, I can guarantee this wouldn't fly in any of the five boroughs.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">2. If you're looking to re-home your pup, it might be a good idea to avoid this family.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Like, how are they going to pay for dog food? Vets? As a proud dog owner, it really irks me when people think that caring for a dog costs no money.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">3. Avoid this company if you've got a Bachelor's degree and two years of production experience under your belt.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Now, I'm used to getting low-balled. But being offered $0 upfront is like... You just have to laugh. Especially when they're requiring a college diploma and two years of [presumably paid] work. For a showbiz-type job that seems to require specialized skills!&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">4. Avoid letting this person crash at your place. Probably.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>I've dealt with my fair share of friend-gaslighting, and let me just say it's not cute. Just a guess here, but it sounds like if this person was a friendly individual, they might not even have to offer a measly $3.50 for a place to lay their heads.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">5. If you're getting rid of your old TV, don't give it to this guy.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Call me old-school, but I would prefer to give my old TV to someone without so many stipulations.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">6. Avoid selling nice furniture to people who would rather shop at discount stores.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>No offense to Walmart, but come on. You can't go on eBay trying to bid for a Prada bag and say that you saw a similar one at Forever21 when your offer is declined.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">7. Avoid this kind of demanding "friend."</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>You're KIDDING me, right? These two clearly haven't spoken in a while, one of them has the gall to ask for a free ROUND-TRIP airplane ticket, the other one is delusional enough to ACCEPT, but that's clearly still not enough.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not tripping, you're tripping.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">8. Artists, beware!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Oh the old, "my child could make that modern art piece." Except he didn't! An artist did, and they should be compensated for their work. Or if you think you're so gifted, stretch your own canvas and go for it. Jeez.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">9. Tattoo artists, avoid conceited and mediocre clients.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>Oh, you wanted a piece until you learned that tattoos cost money? Then you call the artist conceited and mediocre? Boy, bye.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">10. Avoid babysitting for this woman's kids.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>A babysitter you don't have to pay is called a literal parent. Grandparent if you're lucky. You must be kidding if you think someone will change diapers and risk getting thrown up on for free.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">11. Avoid this non-job, even if you are a pious developer.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Admittedly not a job, but for a non-paying assignment, this person sure has some high standards of the person they want to hire use.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">12. Avoid living here unless you're a true masochist.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>$200 for rent seems like a steal. Until you actually read the post and realize you're being asked to babysit a child for eight hours a day, while living in a basement without a kitchen. Oh, and YOU have to be the one to pay. What?!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">13. Unless you're a coder who wants to work six months for free, avoid this gig.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Or take the gig and hope that it's a success. "Probibly will be."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">14. Even if you do have a bus you're willing to loan 20 people for free, I'd probably stay away from this group.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>What's with the aggressive "NEXT's"? Someone needs to take fifty chill pills and MASSIVELY calm down. Or maybe they just "require intoxication." A lot of it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">15. If you're feeling altruistic, maybe avoid giving your change to this guy.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Not like he'd take change anyway! This guy's time can't be wasted for anything less than a $20. Anyone got a six figure salary they can send my way before I waste any more of my time? God bless!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">16. Next time you're thinking about helping a friend get home to see their sick relatives, make sure it's not this one.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>These people who want literally free rides are making me absolutely cringe. I'd be so embarrassed to ask anyone other than a significant other to help me pay my way to see family, but then to turn a generous offer down is just... for shame.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">17. I know people often give away mattresses when they're moving, just don't give it to this person.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>"Oh I wasn't intending on paying for it... If I wanted one for money, I'd go out and buy it."</p><p>So nonchalant and totally unbothered!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">18. I had to do a double-take here.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Web designers and developers work for free because the websites they make are FREE TO VISIT! Makes total sense. And I am hallucinating at the jab this client makes after the guy used "words like rates and estimate."</p><p>I don't know whether to laugh or cry here.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">19. Avoid lending money to the friend who hasn't talked to you in ages.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Sorry, did I say lend? I meant GIVE, obviously. I have to hand it to this guy though, "I know you have some more cash at the moment so I was wondering if you could GIVE ME SOME." I don't even think that's how kids talk to their parents when they're asking for lunch money!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">20. If you see this woman on your next flight, AVOID! Or, pull this move.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Take notes on how to perfectly handle a lousy cheapskate. Seriously, though. Round of applause.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">21. Avoid working for companies that think they're doing YOU a favor.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Can I believe that a company actually sent this to a graphic designer? Five years ago, I would have said no, but even I've gotten this kind of offer where a brand thinks you should be honored and grateful that they would even condescend to work with you. Big NOPE!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">22. Writers, run fast!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>I'm no mathematician, but this comes out to ONE DOLLAR for every 45,454 words. For reference, a really long editorial profile could be something like 8,000 to 10,000 words. So, this beauty company wants one HUNDRED of those. In one piece.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">23. Reasonable copywriters, avoid from this kind of boss.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Plus, a yearly rate increase isn't some insane, unheard-of thing.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">24. Artists, run don't walk away from this guy!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>"If they live with parents, they don't need money. End of story."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">25. If this ain't every graphic designer, tho.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>This meme really sums up the struggle quite elegantly. Wouldn't you say?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKCloryze5FpaHFnYG18dHyObK2zeWBksrnA0Z6knmWTnbKivNKtmKSdow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

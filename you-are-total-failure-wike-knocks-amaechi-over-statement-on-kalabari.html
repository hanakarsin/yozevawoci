A total failure. Even what is supposed to come to us, you blocked it but we didn’t bother.</p><p>“You think you will not finish as a minister, you have left. I hear he can’t even enter Villa now. All those periods you intimidated police people, and army people are over. You use to tell them, ‘The President is angry with you’. Now, go and tell them,” Wike said</p><p>The governor also claimed he elevated Alabo’s stool to the status of a first-class monarch before his passing.</p><p>“Don’t distract us again or else I will say more things,” Wike further warned the former minister.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5BrZrKnpWKus7GMraatmZxis6K1y66pnmWnnrimecqnppyjo2Kurq3EnJ%2BiZZ%2BrsrN50q2YrZ2dmru1ec6nZKSZnJavor7IaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Naija News understands that the advisory was issued on Monday, September 27 by the Pan Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere.
Afenifere challenged President Muhammadu Buhari to do all that he had said to world leaders at the 76th United Nations General Assembly in New York last week.
Afenifere’s National Publicity Secretary, Comrade Jare Ajayi, while reacting to a handbook issued by NYSC to corp members titled, ‘Security Awareness and Education Handbook For Corps Members and Staff’, said allowing the youths to do the compulsory one year service in their home states will reduce the chances of the serving youths being kidnapped."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But despite their objection, thousands of fresh graduates are still being posted to high-risk zones.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FwZqKmo5qwtr7IrbBmmZyhvLh5wqipqatdorKursSrqmarlafDpnnIp2Shp52aerTAwK2crGWRm7KvtcWeqZ5lpJq5rb%2BMp7Csm18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

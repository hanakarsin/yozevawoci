The whodunnit film, starring Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas, was seriously compelling, hilarious, and featured a totally star-studded cast. It should come as no surprise that almost immediately, the film was greenlit for a sequel."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The whodunnit film, starring Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas, was seriously compelling, hilarious, and featured a totally star-studded cast. It should come as no surprise that almost immediately, the film was greenlit for a sequel.</p><p>So, what can we expect from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Knives Out sequel</a>? What is the film's title, and who is in the cast? Stay tuned for everything we know regarding the upcoming sequel, including its official release date.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lionsgate</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rian Johnson revealed that the 'Knives Out' sequel has a new title.</h2><p>Just a couple of months after its November 2019 release, Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer and Motion Picture Group Chairman's Joe Drake <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed a sequel</a>, according to Deadline. The film's plot has been kept under wraps, but director Rian Johnson is ready to provide (some) answers.</p><p>After months of endless speculation about the film, Rian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">went on Twitter</a> on June 13, 2022, to reveal the official title of the Knives Out sequel, along with a special video including all the cast members' names. He wrote, "Something I love about Agatha Christie is how she never tread water creatively. I think there’s a misperception that her books use the same formula over and over, but fans know the opposite is true."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lionsgate</span></figure><p>He continued, "It wasn’t just settings or murder methods, she was constantly stretching the genre conceptually. Under the umbrella of the whodunnit she wrote spy thrillers, proto-slasher horrors, serial killer hunts, gothic romances, psychological character studies, glam travelogues."</p><p>With one final flourish, Rian wrote, "When I made Knives Out, that’s what excited me about the prospect of making more mysteries with Daniel as Benoit Blanc — to emulate Christie and have every film be like a whole new book, with its own tone, ambition, reason for being … and (ta dah) title."</p><p>He added, "Benoit Blanc’s next case, the follow-up to Knives Out, is called GLASS ONION."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lionsgate</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who will be in the 'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery'?</h2><p>Long before Glass Onion even had a green light from Lionsgate, Rian had implied his desire to create a sequel that would bring back <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Craig's character</a>, Benoit Blanc, to investigate a brand new case. Deadline confirmed as much when the news broke of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix winning the deal</a> to stream the impending sequels.</p><p>On May 11, 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline reported</a> that Glass Onion added several big-name stars to its cast roster: Dave Bautista, most well known for his work as Drax the Destroyer in <a href=#>Guardians of the Galaxy</a>; <a href=#>Edward Norton</a>, and Grammy-award nominee <a href=#>Janelle Monáe.</a></p><p>Additional cast members have since been announced, including Katheryn Hahn, Kate Hudson, Madelyn Cline, Leslie Odom Jr., Jessica Henwick, and Ethan Hawke.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does 'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery' have a release date?</h2><p>Filming for Glass Onion began on June 28, 2021, in Greece, and concluded in September 2021, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>. Fans have already begun forming theories about what the odd title could mean for the plot. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">British GQ,</a> the phrase "Glass Onion" originated with the Beatles song of the same name, and "is a metaphor for something both multi-layered and transparent."</p><p>The short teaser trailer that Rian revealed to Twitter also said, "Benoit Blanc is back this holiday season."</p><p>True to his word, the official release date for the film was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unveiled</a> in mid-August 2022. Glass Onion is officially slated to release on Dec. 23, 2022. Now that's a holiday film release for the history books!</p><p>Glass onion: A Knives Out Mystery will be streaming on Netflix and available in select theaters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLuqwsSsZKitpGLApr3UnqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

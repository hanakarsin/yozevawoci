So, we need to do needs assessment. You cannot know the needs of the people when you don’t live with them.</p><p>“For me, competence and experience should be the watchword. Who is competent, more experienced and who will hit the ground running from day one if he becomes governor?</p><p>“Are we going to experiment with a new person again and the person will spend the first four years learning on the job and the next four years trying to embezzle and set up businesses in the name of consolidating on his first term?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5FuZqiakaiyrLXSZpueqKWpxm6%2Fx5qgm61dqbxusMSco5qqlah6qLvVnqmnp6Kotaq8jJqkm6Gknryvec6nZKannpmuuns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

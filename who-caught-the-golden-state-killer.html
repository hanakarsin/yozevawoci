However, before Michelle McNamara began her research, no one believed that the Golden State Killer was just one person.</p><p>DeAngelo is responsible for over 100 crimes, including break-ins, thefts, assaults, and murders all over California. But thanks to McNamara, she was able to connect the dots between all the crimes due to the similar MOs exhibited throughout them all.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Because of McNamara’s research, investigators were able to pull together DNA from evidence that had been sitting in the cold case files and start to piece together who the Golden State Killer really was. However, civilian tips and DNA research were the nails in the coffin for DeAngelo.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did they catch the Golden State Killer?</h2><p>Paul Holes, one of the main investigators on the <a href=#>Golden State Killer case</a>, uploaded a DNA profile to a GED match program, which is a new type of DNA service that can match DNA through genealogy. One of the craziest parts of the Golden State Killer’s story is how it ends. Through DNA that was uploaded to a family genealogy service, investigators were able to narrow down suspects.</p><p>Then, within their pool of six suspects, they knew that whoever the Golden State Killer was had to have blue eyes and premature balding. The only suspect with blue eyes was Joseph DeAngelo. However, Barbara Rae-Venter’s involvement in catching DeAngelo shouldn’t be discounted.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not so fun fact: at least three people from Ventura county have been murdered by two different serial killers.

But she also found a 1979 newspaper clipping that said Joseph DeAngelo, a former police officer, was caught stealing a hammer and a can of dog food. From there, Holes went down his own rabbit hole and started putting together the jigsaw puzzle of DeAngelo’s horrendous crimes.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The final straw was when investigators tailed <a href=#>DeAngelo</a> and matched a current sample of his DNA to the old evidence. They arrested him, and he admitted to everything. “I did all that,” DeAngelo admitted, though he blamed an inner personality he called Jerry.</p><p>He confessed, “I didn’t have the strength to push him out. He made me. He went with me. It was like in my head, I mean, he’s a part of me. I didn’t want to do those things. I pushed Jerry out and had a happy life. I did all those things. I destroyed all their lives. So now I’ve got to pay the price.”</p><p>Today, DeAngelo is serving a life sentence without parole in the California State Prison.</p><p>The epilogue of I'll Be Gone in the Dark airs June 21 at 10 p.m. EST on HBO.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecKarKCgpGLBqbGMoKalnJWjerTAwK2cZqOZobmmvg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

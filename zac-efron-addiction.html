In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter,</a> he admitted to struggling with drugs and alcohol.</p><p>"I was drinking a lot, way too much," he shared. "It’s never one specific thing. I mean, you’re in your 20s, single, going through life in Hollywood, you know? Everything is thrown at you.

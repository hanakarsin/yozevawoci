It has been over a decade since we last saw Dick Wolf's groundbreaking procedural Law & Order take the small screen by storm. Thankfully, we live in a time of reboots and revivals, and Law & Order is finally getting its turn."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

'Law & Order' is back with some new folks on the crime scene. So, who Is Odelya Halevi?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span><p>Odelya Halevi</p></figure><p>It has been over a decade since we last saw <a href=#>Dick Wolf's</a> groundbreaking procedural Law & Order take the small screen by storm. Thankfully, we live in a time of reboots and revivals, and <a href=#>Law & Order is finally getting its turn</a>. We're happy to report that several original characters, as well as the actors who played them, are returning. We're also getting an influx of new kids on the New York block, like actress Odelya Halevi. What can we expect from the newcomer? Here's what we know so far.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Odelya Halevi on 'Law & Order'?</h2><p>Odelya steps into the world of Law & Order as Junior Assistant District Attorney Samantha Maroun. And while her resume isn't quite as long as her other castmates', Odelya absolutely knocked her audition out of the park. Executive producer Rick Eid told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Insider</a>, "Everybody fell in love with her. Dick said, ‘She’s the one!'"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span><p>Odelya Halevi on 'Law & Order'</p></figure><p>Although Odelya is Israeli, and moved to the United States in 2008, her character is Lebanese. "Her personal story informs her point of view," said Rick. In a video for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety Radio Online</a>, Odelya gave us more insight into her character, saying she's "very strong and lovably blunt." "I don't think she likes to take no for an answer," the actress went on to say.</p><p>Regarding her new co-stars, Odelya shared that working with people like <a href=#>Sam Waterston</a> and <a href=#>Hugh Dancy</a> has been "a dream." In fact, Odelya's been a fan of Law & Order since she was a kid. When she was younger, Odelya would watch the show with her mom, which led her to believe that she wanted to be a lawyer. As it turns out, she just wanted to play one on TV.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span><p>Hugh Dancy and Odelya Halevi on 'Law & Order'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What else do we know about Odelya Halevi?</h2><p>In a 2016 interview with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jewish Journal</a>, Odelya spoke about her passion for acting. "I don’t remember a time when I didn’t want to be an actor,” she revealed. "It’s the need to be loved and liked, wanting people to look up to you in some way. It’s a validation."</p><p>When she moved to Los Angeles, Odelya spoke very little English, but she worked on that while waiting for her green card.</p><p>Eventually, Odelya got a commercial agent and started doing commercials, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this one for OnStar</a>. After guest-starring on shows like New Girl, Mike & Molly, and The Bold and the Beautiful, Odelya landed her biggest role yet, as Talia in Good Girls Revolt. The show, based on real-life events, follows three women working for a newspaper in the 1960s. Since they do the work while their male counterparts take all the credit, the women lead a revolution. Sadly, the show didn't make it to a second season.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: YouTube/Odelya Halevi</span><p>Odelya Halevi OnStar commercial</p></figure><p>In the conversation with the Jewish Journal, Odelya expressed an interest in someday returning to Israel to work. "Amazing projects are being made there that I’d love to be a part of," she said. And of course, Odelya misses her family and in particular celebrating Shabbat on Fridays.</p><p>Luckily, the actress has found a community in Los Angeles, where she currently lives. "I sometimes go to temple on Yom Kippur. It takes me back to my childhood and it connects me, and that’s important, to remember where you come from," said Odelya. Currently, we are very interested in where Odelya and her character are going on Law & Order, and cannot wait to tune in.</p><p>Law & Order premieres Thursday Feb. 24 at 8:00 p.m. EST on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKiclaHGonnHmqOerpliuaLDjJqlnWWfp7Gmvg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Source: YouTubeGetting revenge on a cheating ex or someone who's wronged you may seem like a good idea, but more than often it tends to blow up in your face. That's what (quite literally) happened to a woman in a new viral video. In an act that's assumed to be out of revenge, a girl who blew up a Jeep has gone viral."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That's what (quite literally) happened to a woman in a new viral video. In an act that's assumed to be out of revenge, a <a href=#>girl who blew up a Jeep </a>has gone viral.&nbsp;</p><p>The incident, as can be expected, did not go so well for her.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A video of a girl blowing up a jeep went viral.</h2><p>Recently, a video of a girl lighting a Jeep on fire has been making rounds on social media. The video, which was previously posted on Instagram and Twitter, is currently only available on YouTube, depicts the incident.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>In the video, a woman wearing a black hoodie, grey sweatpants, and a face mask can be seen pouring something out of a red gas canister inside a Jeep parked in a parking lot. It's presumed that the liquid she is pouring into the seat is gasoline, as after putting the canister down, she proceeds to use a barbeque lighter to set fire to the car's interior, reaching into the car to ignite the flame.</p><p>As the car catches with a loud boom, the woman can be seen being blown back into the car parked next to the Jeep. She falls over and quickly crawls away from the now-burning vehicle.</p><p>It's at this time her hood is blown off, revealing long, dark hair underneath her hood, though her face is still obscured.</p><p>The woman quickly gathers the gas canister, lighter, and another long, metal object from the shattered glass next to the Jeep and quickly jogs away.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>This entire interaction takes no more than 30 seconds, with the last half of the minute-long video depicting the car slowly being consumed by the flames. Neither of the cars parked on either side appear to be affected by the fire.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Where did the video take place?</h2><p>Since the video first began circulating, there have been various reports that seem to match up with the video, though none have been confirmed yet.</p><p>Some versions of the video claim that the incident took place in Los Angeles, though that cannot be confirmed at this time.</p><p>Another theory also suggested the video took place in Madison, Wis., though the validity of this claim is currently unclear.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Literally the girl who blew up the Jeep ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/SO9FrvaTwI</a></p>â€” cachetÃ³n (@AleWhatHappend) <a href=#>July 24, 2020</a></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WMTV</a>, an NBC affiliate, released a report closely aligning with the events that transpired in the video, though the vehicle in question was a Chevy Impala instead of a Jeep.</p><p>According to the outlet, Kelly S. Hayes was arrested for damage to that vehicle, reporting that the woman used a baseball bat to smash open the car windows before setting it on fire.</p><p>Many of the video titles also suggest that the Jeep's owner was an ex of the woman in the video, though since it is unclear where or when the video actually took place, this, too cannot be confirmed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLazuIywn6hlkqGyuHnUqWSjnZWl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

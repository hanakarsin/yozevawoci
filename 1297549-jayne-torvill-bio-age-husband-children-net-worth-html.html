When she was eight years old, Torvill's teacher began taking her and a few other classmates to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">local skating rink</a>. A local coach noticed how interested she was in the sport and encouraged her to join the <i>Ice Cubs</i>, a skating group that practiced at the rink. This was the beginning of the Olympic medalist's figure skating journey.</p><p class=align-left>As a teen, the determined skater attended Clifton Hall Girls’ Grammar School. She later took up a job as an insurance clerk at the Nottingham Insurance Company, where she worked full time. Her free time was spent at the skating rink.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/422424dbc9557e89.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kathryn Tappen bio: age, salary, net worth, husband, children</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d2d5d46eb0452ccc.jpg><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Her first dalliance with competitive figure skating was in 1971. At the time, she was only 14 with Michael Hutchensen as her skating partner. Together, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">they performed excellently</a> in the British Championships winning gold in 1971 and Silver in 1972.</p><p class=align-left>In 1975, she met Christopher Colin Dean, who worked as a policeman. They had instant chemistry from the start. Although they trained for competitions, the two kept their day jobs. Torvill and Dean age were 18 and 17 respectively.</p><p class=align-left>However, in 1980, they left their day jobs to concentrate on professional ice skating. Their efforts paid off four years later when they won gold at the Olympics in Sarajevo. Theirs was a perfect 6.0 point record in all 12 categories, a record that they still hold to date. The duo moved to professional skiing until 1994 when they were allowed to compete at the Olympics again. As expected, they won a bronze medal. After this, the dynamic duo retired.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/874f4177f431ca2d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Danniella Westbrook bio: All the top details about her age, kids, drug abuse, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Many people curiously ask, ‘how old are Torvill and Dean?'

She hit her with his car and run. At Ikate few hour ago, he hit my sister car and she came down to ask him to look what he did, this heartless human was asking for number and she told him he would block her, rather for @timayatimaya to do the needful. He hit my sister with his car and ran away. She is at the hospital right now in serious pain and funniest part is me messaging him on Instagram to do the needful but this needless fellow blocked me after reading my message.”</p><p>Watch video below;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/275201628_751169922534238_6912557370426882440_n-300x300.jpg alt width=300 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e49sZq%2BhlJq8brzOpaCcnV2Wv7Ox0q1kraGdlsaiecCmoJ2rpGK1qsCMmqWdZaKqu26%2BxKmmq6xf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

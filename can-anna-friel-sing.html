And yes, that’s actually her singing in the new Fox series Monarch, premiering tonight, Sunday, Sept. 11, after the NFL’s Packers-Vikings game.</p><p style=text-align:start>After all, Anna would practically have to sing to star in what Fox describes “a <a href=#>Texas-sized, multi-generational musical drama</a> about America’s first family of country music.”</p><p style=text-align:start>In Monarch, Susan Sarandon plays Dottie Cantrell Roman, the “insanely talented, but tough-as-nails queen of country music” and the matriarch of a musical dynasty.</p><p style=text-align:start>“But even though the Roman name is synonymous with authenticity, the very foundation of their success is a lie,” Fox says.</p><p style=text-align:start>And that’s where Anna’s character comes in: “Heir to the crown Nicolette ‘Nicky’ Roman will stop at nothing to protect her family’s legacy, while ensuring her own quest for stardom,” the network adds.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Anna Friel has “always sung,” and Simon Cowell offered her a record contract when she was a teenager.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span><p>Anna Friel in 'Monarch'</p></figure><p style=text-align:start>In describing the soundtrack of her life in a 2017 NME interview, Anna said that she has “always sung” and that she once caught the eye of record executive (and <a href=#>former American Idol judge</a>) <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a>.</p><p style=text-align:start>“I was offered contracts when I was young, but I didn’t think I’d be taken seriously as an actress, and it wouldn’t have been the music I wanted to do. It was kindly offered by Simon Cowell when I was about 17. Going from a soap [Channel 4’s Brookside] to being a singer would have held a stigma.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">She grew up around Irish folk music, thanks to her father.</h2><p style=text-align:start>Anna told NME she “wasn’t really into pop music” growing up. “My dad plays amazing guitar and writes, so I was brought up around Irish traditional folk music and was a bit of a snob,” she said. “I only knew Wham! and Bananarama.” (According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Closer</a>, Anna’s father is a former folk guitarist who was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and grew up in County Donegal, Ireland.)</p><p style=text-align:start>In fact, her homegrown musical taste might not have jived with record execs like Simon. “I don’t think they’d have been interested in me doing traditional folk music,” she told NME.</p><p style=text-align:start>The actress elaborated on her run-in with Simon in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2006 Mirror interview</a>, saying, “I sing folk music really, the level and the quality of what [Simon] presents us with now is far beyond anything I could do. I actually saw him in New York seven years later. He called me over and said, ‘Well done, you said no’. So sometimes ‘no’ is a powerful word.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Anna has sung on the West End as well.</h2><p style=text-align:start>Anna also showed off her singing voice as she starred as Holly Golightly in a 2009 production of Breakfast at Tiffany’s. And during one performance of the shower, an audience member caused a ruckus by vomiting on six other theatergoers. But Anna kept the show going, as she later told Smooth Radio.</p><p style=text-align:start>“Someone had vomited from the balcony over six people, and they were being escorted out to be cleaned up,” she explained, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Metro</a>. “I carried on singing but almost lost my way as there was such a noise coming from the seats. I’m proud I kept my concentration.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6vecCnpZpllqe2priMrKCnnw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

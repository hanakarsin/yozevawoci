See Agu's original message in part:</p><p><i>"This overrated son of a b***h with his amateurish acting skills thinks his name can bring any good to a writer or a blogger. The man with a tainted name, a rogue who has burnt every bridge he stepped on is trying to hold me responsible for what ever misfortune that has fallen him in the last 72 hours.</i></p><p><i>"So this montebank sneaked into New York around 5am 3 days ago and did everything to keep it a top secret until the bubble burst right in front of him. When I got the hint that James was in Keturah’s house, I thought Keturah was lying . The girl said James came claiming that his relationship with Nadia Buari was over. She also said James (Jim) came to pick her up from Nigeria. I told her this guy might be lying.</i></p><p><i>"When I got in touch with Nadia's manager, he maintained that Nadia was aware Jim went to Miami and insisted he (Jim) was no way near Keturah's house."</i></p><p>According to Agu, he had the insulting talk by Iyke recorded on tape and will <i>"play it to my world audience by 8AM New York time, which should be 1PM Nigerian Time.&nbsp;I need everyone out there to listen and find out why Jim Iyke should be taken off the streets. The guy can never change. That deliverance by TB Joshua never worked. It was a fluke."</i></p><p>He also called Iyke a "psycho", "disappointment", "fraudster" and "cheat", saying he must be arrested over threatening Agu's life.&nbsp;</p><p>This story comes as a big disappointment after the <a href=#>recently publicized engagement of Jim and Nadya</a>.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3eBlW9loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

As we speak, we do not have full details of who is behind the import, the country of import and the model of guns. All these will be made known at the end of the investigations.</p><p>“Most times, the suspect you see is those freight forwarders and agents coming for examination, but we are more interested in getting to the importer and everyone involved in that criminal importation to nip it in the bud.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze5BxZpynnqmuqrrEq2SfoZyhsqV51qKroWWRqMCwvtOem2afpaPAbrXNrZyrm5WlwaawjKKlZqSRnLy0ec%2Boqa1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

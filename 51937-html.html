Kunle Fagbamigbe, a resident of Ibadan, expressed his joy at being part of the great show. According to him, ‘it is good to have these artistes come to perform, at this season of the year, especially, shortly, after some of them have just released new singles and albums, like KCEE’s “Okoso”’.&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>Participants, in the karaoke session, that held at the concert were glad to have been granted such an opportunity to share the stage with their favourite artistes, as well as take pictures and receive autographs.</p><p class=MsoNormal>The female fans were, particularly, excited. Most of them came with placards bearing the images of the artistes and messages of endearment. Speaking to some of them, they appreciated the fact that MTN brought such a high-profile concert to their city.</p><p class=MsoNormal>Almost all the artistes engaged the audience, in different forms of dances, starting from ‘skelewu’, the latest dance style. Davido, the originator of the dance, was a class act. Brimming with exceptional youthful energy and a unique voice, the ‘Omo-baba-olowo’ left his Ibadan fans with a good memory.</p><p class=MsoNormal>Sound Sultan, one of the music industry’s most consistent artistes, did justice to the status of his new single, ‘Natural Something’. His performance drew a huge applause from the crowd who kept dancing and asking for more.</p><p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile, MTN Project Fame, the telecommunications and ICT company’s platform for nurturing young talented musicians, made an invaluable contribution to the concert. Being the most popular talent-hunt initiative in West Africa, the platform contributed no fewer than six artistes to the concert. Chidinma, Praiz, iMike, Monica, Ayo, Oyinkansade and Adetoun &nbsp;had a remarkable evening and Ibadan youths appreciated their performances as applauses greeted each of these artiste’s showmanship on stage.</p><p class=MsoNormal>Wizkid, a favourite, among Ibadan youths, was thrilled with the large turn-out. He said the passion he witnessed from the Ibadan crowd was unbelievable. In his words – ‘they love a good show’.</p><p class=MsoNormal>The MTN ‘Loud in Naija’ musical concert will be held in five more cities in Nigeria. The cities are Port Harcourt, Abuja, Ilorin, Owerri and Lagos.

From Nene Leakes‚Äôs uber comment to Porsha Williams‚Äô underground railroad beliefs, there is always something brewing on the show. But now, Kenya has found herself in the middle of backlash because of one of her fashion choices. Here‚Äôs everything we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kenya is catching a lot of heat for wearing a Native American headdress on the last episode of 'The Real Housewives of Atlanta.'</h2><p>The ladies of the show are always putting on themed events and parties. And because this past episode‚Äôs party theme was Halloween, many of the ladies stepped out in their finest to enjoy the occasion. However, viewers couldn‚Äôt look past Kenya‚Äôs choice of garb for the festivities.</p><p>In the episode, Kenya donned a Native American headdress. There was no getting past the fact that it was a clear example of cultural appropriation. And the topic left some of her co-stars ready to attack her about it.</p><p>See, most of the other ladies decided to opt for wearing cat-inspired costumes, but Kenya decided to go against the grain.

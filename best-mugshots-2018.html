Unclear why he tacked on the "Jeez Fizzy" after his first name — my guess is it was to throw fans off his scent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This lottery winner laughed his way right out of the bank.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>I had to do some extra sleuthing to figure out why exactly this guy was laughing so hard in his mugshot, but now that I know, I'm laughing right with him.&nbsp;</p><p>It turns out that after winning the lottery, this man thought it would be a great use of his newly earned riches to dump $200,000 worth of manure on his ex-boss's lawn. His boss clearly did not think it was as funny and called the police, but even after being handcuffed and arrested, this man simply can't stop laughing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This woman and her neighbor didn't see eye to eye.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This woman's oversized eyelashes are everything. I'm actually surprised no makeup line has jumped on board to replicate this iconic look. Kylie, here's looking at you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not sure if this should be surprising or not, but this woman was arrested for pouring hot grease on a woman, resulting in terrible burns to her back and arms. When the internet read the news, they couldn't stop themselves from puns like "Eye can't understand why she would do such a thing."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Joker</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>Unclear what was going through the head of this heavily tatted "Miami Joker" when he voluntarily inked himself as a tribute to his favorite film, but I'm glad he did it anyway. His tattoos aren't even the funniest part about him; when he was arrested for pointing a gun at passing vehicles in (where else?) Florida, he told the cops he didn't have a concealed weapon permit because "it's expensive."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>Clearer mugshots for this two-time arrestee apparently also show "a vulgar message directed at The Batman," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tampa Bay Times</a> reports.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Necklected Criminal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p><a href=#>We've already covered</a> the priceless puns this man's arrest unleashed upon the internet, but no 2018 mugshot roundup would be complete without taking another moment to appreciate this guy's fantastic picture.&nbsp;</p><p>Hey, the camera adds 20 pounds, right?&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Every Damn Day</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>This guy looks like his idea of a good weekend is getting arrested in different graphic tees.

This woman decided she wouldn't leave any photo ops on the table, and wowed the cops with this pose that accentuates her facial piercings. Classy!&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tell me it was a MOOOving violation.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>No other crime would justify this outfit for me.

The last time Halsey threw fans in a craze was when she hit us all with a <a href=# style=text-align:start>surprise pregnancy announcement</a> she posted back in January 2021. It was at that time that many of us became acquainted with Halsey's now-ex-boyfriend. But it appears she has found herself a new man!</p><p>Find out more about Halsey's current boyfriend and get the scoop on her <a href=#>past relationships</a>.

In September 2023, she and Avan were out together in Los Angeles and reportedly had a makeup session at the Cara Hotel in Los Feliz. Then, in October 2023, Halsey took to Instagram to share photos of her and her new man wearing black leather ensembles.</p><p>Fans and followers of the singer didn't waste any time dropping their thoughts on her outfit and her move to go public with her relationship with Avan. Although Halsey hasn't confirmed that she's dating the actor, her picture speaks for itself! To further confirm the two are mingling, Avan also posted a photo of him and Halsey wearing matching Halloween costumes. He was dressed as a sailor, while she was dressed as a siren.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Avan Jogia (@jogia)</a></p></figure><p>If you recognize Avan but can't quite put your finger on why, we're here to help. Avan has starred in quite a few notable films and TV shows including Victorious, in which he<strong> </strong>played the role of Beck Oliver. He also landed the role as Danny Desai in Twisted and Rex Galier in Netflix's <a href=#>Choose Love</a>.</p><p>In terms of past relationships, Avan was linked to <a href=#>Zoey Deutch</a> in 2012, and later dated <a href=#>Cleopatra Coleman</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Halsey dated Alev Aydin, also her baby daddy, for more than four years before splitting in April 2023.</h2><p>Halsey's former partner and baby daddy is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alev Aydin</a>. He's a screenwriter and producer who's best known for his work on the TV series Small Shots (which he created) and the short HipMen: Los Angeles (which he wrote and directed). He also appeared as an actor in a few episodes of General Hospital and starred in the 2018 thriller Cruel Hearts.</p><p>Beyond that, Alev is a bit of a mystery man. He doesn't appear to be super active on social media (although he does have a bunch of very adorable pictures from his youth on his Instagram). Halsey also hasn't revealed too much about their relationship (well, other than the existence of the child who is apparently a result of it).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by halsey (@iamhalsey)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Halsey and Alev welcomed their baby in July 2021.</h2><p>On July 19, 2021, Halsey posted the above adorable photo of her, Alev, and their little one: Ender Ridley Aydin, who was born on July 14, 2021. "Gratitude. For the most 'rare' and euphoric birth. Powered by love," Halsey wrote in the caption.</p><p>In October 2021, Halsey took to social media again to share an update not about her family but instead about her postpartum body, writing on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>: "My body has felt like a stranger’s for a long time. A lot of people don’t know that you still look pregnant for a while after."</p><p>She continued: "It is still changing and I am letting it. I have no interest in working out right now. I’m too tired and too busy playing with my darling son."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by halsey (@iamhalsey)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Before Alev, Halsey was linked to her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend's ex. (Got all that?)</h2><p>Yup, Hollywood is a small place, and the concept of six degrees of separations gets a lot smaller there. Back in 2018, Halsey and rapper G-Eazy, who she had been dating for more than a year, split up, and it wasn't pretty. It seems that she all but said outright that her former beau <a href=#>cheated on her</a>.</p><p>The same summer that Halsey and G-Eazy broke up, actor <a href=#>Ashley Benson</a> and supermodel <a href=#>Cara Delevingne</a> started dating. Their relationship would last until May 2020, when it was confirmed that <a href=#>Ashley and Cara had split</a>. Shortly after the breakup became public, Ashley was spotted out with none other than G-Eazy himself (she is now engaged to Brandon Davis).</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Fast forward to August, and the rumors surrounding Ashley and G-Eazy's relationship got even more wild, when she was photographed on a grocery run with the rapper, while rocking what looks like a large diamond ring. Although the two had never even officially announced that they were dating, suddenly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">engagement rumors</a> were abound.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cara was rumored to be dating model <a href=#>Kaia Gerber</a> and actor Margaret Qualley (both <a href=#>Pete Davidson</a>'s exes, by the way, because, again, Hollywood is really, really small). In both cases, though, Cara never addressed the rumors, and it remains unknown if the relationships were anything more than strong, affectionate friendships.</p><p>However, sources informed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a> that Cara and Halsey did get together. That's right — rumors say that Halsey had gotten together with her ex's new girlfriend's ex.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>HALSEY & CARA ARE DATING WE KEEP WINNING GAYS <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cwsGifBQ2X</a></p>— k ⚢ (@msblanchtt) <a href=#>September 5, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Cara and Halsey's rumored relationship was reportedly not too serious.</h2><p>As opposed to G-Eazy and Ashley, it looks like Halsey and Cara's relationship wasn't quite as serious, though. The source, who claims to be close to the Carnival Row star, said, "Cara has been hooking up with Halsey in the last few weeks and they’ve been having a laugh together. It’s all very casual and just a bit of fun."</p><p>They clarified, "Neither of them are particularly keen to be tied down and they’re fine about seeing other people. They’ve both been very open about their sexuality and just want to enjoy themselves so they’re both on the same wavelength. They’re usually so busy and flying around the world, but as they’ve been stuck in LA in recent months, it’s given them a chance to see each other."</p><p>"Cara has kissed her in front of friends and stuff. It’s not a big deal for either of them," the source said. “It’s actually just funny to them that their exes are together now, and there’s no hard feelings.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKGZnKiyunnDmquippdiu7DD</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Source: YouTubeThere's no doubt that the time leading up to the Season 18 premiere of The Ellen DeGeneres Show was riddled with controversy. Between the claims of unfair treatment of the people who work on the show, accusations of abuse, and allegations of systemic racism, there were questions on if the show would continue at all."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Between the claims of unfair treatment of the people who work on the show, accusations of abuse, and allegations of systemic racism, there were questions on if the show would continue at all. When Ellen hosted the premiere episode on Sept. 21, 2020 and addressed the elephants in the room, the reaction was mixed — but she vowed to do better. But, <a href=#><strong>why is tWitch hosting </strong><strong>Ellen</strong></a><strong> </strong>now?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why Is tWitch hosting 'The Ellen Show'?</h2><p>When viewers tuned in to The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Sept. 25, 2020, instead of seeing Ellen on the stage, fans saw Stephen "tWitch" Boss, typically the DJ of the show and newly announced co-executive producer, in the hosting role.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>, tWitch filled in as guest host for the episode "to take over during her temporary absence." There were no additional details listed as to why Ellen was absent, but fans were thrilled to get to know more about tWitch on the episode.&nbsp;</p><p>Filling in for his typical DJ position on the show was a guest DJ and his wife, Allison Holker Boss. During his opening monologue, tWitch didn't mention why Ellen was away, but did say that now that he's taken on the role of co-executive producer of the show, he was tasked with finding someone who could fill in — so he found someone: himself.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Be sure to check out the @theellenshow today!

However, the following Friday, Oct. 2, tWitch was, once again, acting as host.&nbsp;</p><p>On the following Friday's show, there were no publications reporting before the show that he would once again take over. However, tWitch himself shared the news on his Instagram account Oct. 1, letting his fans know to tune in.</p><p>"Guess what y’all?!!" he wrote on Instagram.

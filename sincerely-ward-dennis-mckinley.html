Source: GettyThough there's never exactly a shortage of drama on Bravo's The Real Housewives of Atlanta, the upcoming Season 12 premiere will be especially intense. Porsha Williams has never been afraid to call someone out or throw shade in the seven seasons she's been on the show, but someone is about to confront her over an alleged cheating scandal between her and fiancÃ© Dennis McKinley."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Sincerely Ward, a WAGS Atlanta star, is joining the season premiere, and she is the alleged mistress of Dennis. What's the tea with <a href=#>Sincerely Ward and Dennis McKinley?</a> We have details on their alleged affair, and why Sincerely is on the season premiere.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sincerely Ward and Dennis McKinley allegedly had an affair.</h2><p>Rumors of a tryst between Sincerely and Dennis first began swirling when a gossip vlogger, Tasha K, posted a video about it in the summer. Dennis and Sincerely denied the claims, even going as far as to say they never met, but it didn't stop the story from spreading. Porsha and Dennis broke up shortly thereafter (and got back together soon), which might have been the closest thing we could get to confirmation â€” until the season premiere.&nbsp;</p><p>At Kandi Burruss' new restaurant, Old Lady Gang, she, Cynthia Bailey, and Eva Marcille were grabbing a bite to eat when Sincerely approached their table. She already appeared to be acquainted with the women, but she still shocked them when she began to speak about why she was there.</p><p>"I'm sorry, I didn't want to interrupt you guys," Sincerely said. "I actually, I kinda saw you, so I feel like I should take an opportunity, because I wanted to mention something to you. Can I sit down for a second?"</p><p>"I donâ€™t know if you've been, like, on the internet or heard anything, or seen anything," she continued. "But apparently there's this story out and Iâ€™m this girl in a blog thatâ€™s supposedly a mistress to Porsha's fiance. I'm 'the mistress.'" The women looked shocked. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In an exclusive with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET</a>, Sincerely said that she hopes her cameo on RHOA will allow viewers to finally hear her side of the rumors.&nbsp;</p><p>"People who know me really know the truth," she told ET. "Once you see the episode on Sunday, I really feel like, everybody will see the truth of whatâ€™s really real. So, thatâ€™s really all I have to say about it. After that, Iâ€™m not going to respond to it or talk about it anymore."</p><p>Though the teaser clip appeared to show a confession from Sincerely, we have a feeling that isn't the extent of her visit with the cast. It will be interesting to see one of the three cast members having to tell Porsha about what went down at Kandi's restaurant. Knowing Porsha's temper, this will likely be a big storyline for the season.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sincerely Ward was on Wags Atlanta.</h2><p>If Sincerely looks or sounds familiar, it's because she's a fixture on reality TV. She began her career as a model, before making the shift to acting, producing, and reality TV. She had small roles in films like Bad Boys II, Spider-Man 3, and 2 Fast 2 Furious.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>More @beautycon fun with boss lady @kandi, the lovely @kellyrowland, my niece @iamskylarmarie, the hilarious @lalamilan & my sweetheart superstar dJ @shesmaad ðŸ’„ #theadventuresofSincerely #beautyconla #beautyconbabe #beautycon #beautyconnyc #influencer #luxurytravel #conciergeservices #privateaviation #celebjetbroker #travelinfluencer #jetbroker #beautyinfluencer #prettylittlething</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Sincerely Ward</a> (@sincerelyw) on Aug 16, 2019 at 2:25pm PDT</p></figure><p>Sincerely was on the only season of WAGS Atlanta, which aired in 2018 on E! She's the cousin of Derrick Ward, a former NFL running back, which is how she earned a spot on the show. She's also a mom to an 11-year-old daughter, and she cares for her 14-year-old nephew.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sincerely Ward's Instagram.&nbsp;</h2><p>She has a strong presence on Instagram, with nearly 90,000 followers (which will likely increase once the show airs). She posted a cryptic picture on Instagram of a quote that might be hinting at her feelings about the upcoming episode.</p><p>"Rules to live by," the text on the photo reads. "Don't hate on nobody, don't wait on nobody."&nbsp;</p><p>It's unclear if the reality star also made an appearance on RHOA in a bid to get a coveted spot on the show.

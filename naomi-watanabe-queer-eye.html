Source: Kelli Falls/NetflixWe know we're not alone in eagerly counting down the days for Queer Eye to return. But we're more excited about this season than ever — because the Fab Five are leaving behind their usual midwestern jaunts to take us all the way to Japan, where they'll be helping four new heroes achieve televised glow-ups."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Her adolescence wasn't "the best environment," Naomi admits to The Cut. "I turned to music and comedy to take my mind off my parents fighting. To break the silence or clear negative air, I would say something funny and make my parents laugh. That's what got me hooked on it."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"When I make people laugh, it gives me joy," she says. And we can't wait to see how this translates to Queer Eye, where so many of the heroes are in desperate need of someone to inject love and joy into their lives. "The feeling is something you can't describe. IT's almost orgasmic."</p><p>Tune into Queer Eye: We're in Japan! when the four-episode season streams November 1 on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo66wuchmrpqskaOuo7GMqqyenaJisrqx</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

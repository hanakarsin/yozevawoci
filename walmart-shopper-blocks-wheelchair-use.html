How am I blocking you in?" the person asks again.</p><p>"I have a ramp," the wheelchair-bound dad shouts back, "I cannot get in my car," he tells them.</p><p>"Y'all I'm so over it," he says, speaking directly into the camera again, before criticizing the way the person parked their vehicle.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @itsgoneviral</span></figure><p>"And if that's just your parking strategy as a grown adult, you need an eye exam, then you need a DMV visit, and then you need a driver's ed course, because my quadriplegic crippled fat a-- can drive and park much better than that in reverse," he says.</p><p>He then adds that the other car owner his approaching him, "This person's walking up right now they are not going to be happy," the dad says right before the clip jumps ahead yet again, showing that the person who parked too close to his vehicle is driving what looks like a Honda sedan.</p><p>"I'm waiting," he says as the person approaches his car.</p><p>"It's over just a little bit and I have a handicapped sticker," the driver tells the dad, who replies, "All I'm asking, it's 50 degrees, hey listen, you came and hollered at me through the gate."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @itsgoneviral</span></figure><p>The Honda driver denies this series of events, "No I came to see if it was my car."</p><p>The wheelchair-bound dad replies, "Then you took the time to go check out before you came out?"</p><p>"Yeah," the driver responds, "I've been in the store."</p><p>"I've been in the store!" the dad screams back at the Honda car owner.</p><p>"You know what you could have said hey I'm not going to be in a rush so instead of sitting out there in the cold you and your son might wanna go sit inside just a little bit of consideration."</p><p>"I had to check out," the driver responds back to him.</p><p>Right after this, the man's son chimes in, "It makes me mad cause someone doesn't do five seconds of their life just to make it easier for someone else. Even if you don't know why not just be nice and try," he says at the end of the video.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @itsgoneviral</span></figure><p>Numerous folks who saw the video agreed with the sentiment expressed by the young boy, extolling him for his "be nice and try" philosophy of life.</p><p>What do you think?

Though with a mix of Christians but dominantly Muslims, Naija News understands.</p><p>“We must either use the security or other means to eliminate the governor, his family and all those they perceive as supporting him,” Pantami and the Muslim leaders were quoted saying in the communique adopted at the meeting held at Bauchi Central Mosque.</p><p>The meeting complained that Mr Yakowa was making moves to contest for governor in 2011 and he had the support of former President Goodluck Jonathan, a fellow Christian.</p><p>Naija News understands that Yakowa contested in 2011 and won a substantive four years term. He was, however, killed in the helicopter crash barely a year in office.</p><p>Though there were suspicions that the event is more than just an accident, and investigation into what happened was never concluded or made public until recent controversy about the President Muhammadu Buhari’s minster.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH11e5FqZqmZnqmurrWMqKuhnaJiu7C%2B06Gcq6ZdobKisMSrqmaZnKGyqLHDpbBmqJyWu6%2Bxw2aYrKuRqMCqusCtoKimXaSzbrjArZxmo5GZwq%2BtjKCmr52io7yzediaoqivkWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

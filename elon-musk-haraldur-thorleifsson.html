On Monday, March 6, Haraldur sent a tweet Elon’s way to ask about his own employment status."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You’ve not answered my emails. Maybe if enough people retweet, you’ll answer me here?”</p><p style=text-align:start>And Elon certainly answered…</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Elon Musk claims Haraldur Thorleifsson “did no actual work.”</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p style=text-align:start>Elon <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">replied</a> to Haraldur’s tweet on Monday to ask what work the Iceland-based employee had been doing. But after Haraldur listed his accompaniments at the company, Elon replied with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">crying-laughing emojis</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a clip from Office Space</a>.</p><p style=text-align:start>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a Twitter thread</a> that day, Haraldur wrote, “[Musk] asked me what I had been working on. When I told him he laughed. Which, to be fair, I get. I am quite funny. Then all of [a] sudden, Twitter’s head of HR (who had previously twice been unable to tell me if I had a job or not) emailed and said I was no longer employed. … Next up, though, is finding out if Twitter will pay me what they owe me, per my contract. Or, will @elonmusk, one of the richest people in the world, try to avoid paying?”</p><p style=text-align:start>On Tuesday, March 7, Elon aired his accusations: “The reality is that this guy (who is independently wealthy) did no actual work, claimed as his excuse that he had a disability that prevented him from typing, yet was simultaneously tweeting up a storm,” he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. “Can’t say I have a lot of respect for that.”</p><p style=text-align:start>In another tweet, Elon <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>, “But was he fired? No, you can’t be fired if you weren’t working in the first place!”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Gotta look proper for those job interviews. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9C3OZtDDEj</a></p>— Halli (@iamharaldur) <a href=#>March 1, 2023</a></figure><p style=text-align:start>Elon also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> that Haraldur confronted him in public to get a “big payout,” saying that Haraldur has a “prominent, active” Twitter acount. “From what I’ve been told, he’s done almost no work for the past four months, middle-management or otherwise,” the CEO added.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Haraldur, though, said he did his assigned tasks — “every one of them” — while living with muscular dystrophy.</h2><p style=text-align:start>Responding to Elon’s claims, Haraldur <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a Twitter thread</a> on Tuesday to talk about his condition, saying that he has muscular dystrophy and started using a wheelchair 20 years ago, when he was 25. “In that time, the rest of my body has been failing me, too,” he wrote. “I need help to get in and out of bed and use the toilet.”</p><p style=text-align:start>He went on: “I’m not able to do manual work (which in this case means typing or using a mouse) for extended periods of time without my hands starting to cramp. I can, however, write for an hour or two at a time. This wasn’t a problem in Twitter 1.0 since I was a senior director, and my job was mostly to help teams move forward [and] give them strategic and tactical guidance.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hello new friends!</p><p>You don't have to like me but I think you're pretty great.</p><p>Here is my favorite photo.

The hard work paid off, and the company became very successful. We grew fast and made money. I think that’s what you are referring to when you say independently wealthy? That I independently made my money, as opposed to, say, inherited an emerald mine.”</p><p style=text-align:start>Joshua Erlich, an employment and civil rights attorney, gave his thoughts about Elon and Haraldur’s dispute to The Daily Beast. “Musk’s ‘the reality is’ tweet reads like Musk looked up this employee’s human resources file and is tweeting out the company’s internal reasoning for the termination,” he said. “That reasoning seems pretty problematic, and it would be more than enough to carry [a] disability discrimination or failure to accommodate case deep into litigation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrmwuoymrKyjXZ2us63LnayrZaSdvLO4xKKdrKufow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

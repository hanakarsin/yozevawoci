According to a recent episode of RHOBH, the former foes bonded in an unlikely way. In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bravo teaser</a> of the cast’s trip to Mexico, Sutton informs the ladies she met someone online.</p><p>Sutton, who divorced <a href=#>Christian Stracke</a> in 2016, seems excited and nervous about meeting her new beau for the first time. At one point, Erika scoots next to Sutton so they can look at his dating profile. Erika offers her stamp of approval, letting her co-star know she thinks her date is “hot.” She also encourages Sutton not to be discouraged by dating a younger man after she reveals that the mystery man is younger than her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Sutton Stracke (@suttonstracke)</a></p></figure><p>As the women bond over Sutton’s dating life, Crystal and Lisa start gushing over how “awesome” it is to see the two of them having a friendly banter.

"But sometimes she's kinda funny. And I like funny people."</p><p>However, while Erika also enjoyed her time with Sutton, she isn’t ready to set their friendship in stone. After Crystal and Dorit noted their progress with the “XXPensive” singer, she said she’s not prepared to forget and forgive Sutton’s actions.</p><p>"I don't put expectations on anything," Erika declares. “Nice moments are nice moments for me, and that's where I'm at.

When Erika asked why, she replied by saying, “Because I don’t like you.” After Erika told Sutton the feelings were mutual, the two exchanged “f--k yous” before going their separate ways. However, their time “on the Bumble” helped mend the connection.</p><p>Since Mexico, Erika and Sutton made another stride in their relationship by following each other on Instagram again, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>.

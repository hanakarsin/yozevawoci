Let's meet the fam.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@emilybaldoni</a><p>The kids and their dog Happy pictured in 2020</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who are Justin Baldoni's children? He shares two kids with his wife, Emily.</h2><p>First, a little bit about Justin: The Oregon native is an actor, writer, and director. In fact, he directed It Ends With Us in addition to starring in it, so we're already impressed. And if you feel like Justin looks familiar, it's probably because you recognize him as Rafael Solano from the 2014–'19 TV series <a href=#>Jane the Virgin</a>.</p><p>In 2013, Justin married his girlfriend of over a year, Swedish actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily Fuxler</a>. Emily has starred in a number of high-profile films and television projects, including 2009's Ghosts of Girlfriends Past and a spot on Mad Men in 2012. She's also appeared in some of Justin's directorial projects, like 2019's Five Feet Apart and 2020's Clouds.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Justin Baldoni (@justinbaldoni)</a></p></figure><p>After Justin and Emily got married in Corona, Calif., they went on to welcome two children together. Their firstborn — a daughter named Maiya — came along in June 2015. Their second child — a son named Maxwell — joined the family in October 2017.</p><p>In 2021, Justin spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bump</a> about trying to teach his children about the things that "the world is going to try and unteach them." He explained that while the world is going to try to train his daughter to be "polite and pretty," while training his son to feel like he has to be "impenetrable" and unable to cry, he wants to "instill the opposing virtues" in his kids to balance it out.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Emily Baldoni (@emilybaldoni)</a></p></figure><p>"For example, I’m teaching my daughter to take physical risks, to take up space and that it’s OK to be loud sometimes. She was born liking pink — and that’s OK. But she’s also a damn good athlete. Every night we say mantras, like 'I’m brave, I’m strong and powerful.' When it comes to her, I always lead with the more 'masculine' words. 'I’m a leader, I’m resiliant.' I want her to have these qualities despite the world telling her she shouldn’t," he explained.</p><p>"And for my son, I’m focusing on the qualities the world tells him it’s not OK to have: empathy, compassion, sensitivity. So at night, I start with more feminine words for him: 'I am patient, I’m loving, I’m kind,'" he said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Emily Baldoni (@emilybaldoni)</a></p></figure><p>We love to see it!

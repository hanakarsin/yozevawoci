On our development objectives, gas will have a key role to play here for some years before being phased out,” he said.</p><p>President Buhari revealed that the target is to provide electricity and cooking solutions for people in Nigeria.</p><p>According to him, an often-overlooked point is the essential role of gas in addressing clean cooking challenges.</p><p>He noted, “Globally there are 2.6 billion people who lack access to clean cooking – which is unacceptable.</p><p>“Even more concerning is that solid fuel cooking in Africa causes almost 490,000 premature deaths annually, making it the second-largest health risk in Africa.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FuZp%2Bhppp6rrXLpaCopl2dvLa%2FxKGmpZyjYsGwecaeq2adnJqwtb7InKCtsV2Xxm5%2Bj2xnZpqlna6ztY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

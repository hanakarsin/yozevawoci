The substance of that accord was our&nbsp;commitment to free, fair and credible elections in our dear&nbsp;country.

We therefore&nbsp;call on all fellow citizens of our dear country, and our part&nbsp;supporters, to refrain from violence or any acts that may in any way jeopardise our collective vision of a free, fair and credible&nbsp;election.</i></p><p><i>"In addition, we call on INEC and all security agencies to ensure strict adherence to their constitutional roles. We also pledge to respect the outcome of free, fair and credible&nbsp;elections.</i></p><p><i>"Today, we again renewed our commitment to a united,&nbsp;democratic and prosperous Nigeria.

Buhari despite his late arrival last night or early arrival this morning, was kind enough to meet with this committee.</i></p><p><i>"In essence, all the meetings were held to brief them the current situation of the country and what we expect of them as stakeholders and as presidential candidates. I want to thank both the president and Gen. Buhari for finding time to meet with the committee. And I want to thank both party chairmen for the support received in trying to send this message of peace.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>"I'm happy both parties, the contestants, are committed to free and fair elections, free of violence. And this morning a document to reiterate their commitment for this peaceful and for the forthcoming elections".</i></p><p>Earlier this year, all <a href=#>presidential aspirants for the March 28 poll and the leaders of their political parties signed an undertaking to avoid actions that could endorse violence before, during and after the elections.&nbsp;</a></p><p>It was also reported that the key presidential candidates General Muhammadu Buhari from the APC and incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan from the ruling the PDP <a href=#>shook hands and embraced after receiving remarks renouncing violence.</a></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXGFkm9vZqKfo661tMCnZKydpGLBsHnHqKOdZaSWuay%2FjLCgraBdl8KprdGiZJqsXam1pnmQaquhZZikwrN6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

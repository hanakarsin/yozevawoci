Toward the end of the debate, Biden mentioned his late son, Beau, who served as an officer in the Iraq War and tragically died from a brain tumor in 2015. Biden said, “My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got the Bronze Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a patriot, and the people left behind there were heroes."</p><p>Beau's Bronze Star was brought up once again just after the <a href=#>attempted assassination</a> of former <a href=#>President Donald Trump</a>. During a July 2024 Zoom call involving the President and dozens of Democratic lawmakers, Biden exchanged words with Rep. Jason Crow, saying, “Tell me something you’ve never done with your Bronze Star like my son,” according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Puck</a>. This comment sparked anger, particularly from <a href=#>Meghan McCain</a>. With Beau’s Bronze Star back in the spotlight, many are wondering: why did he receive it?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why did Beau Biden get a Bronze Star?</h2><p>Beau was deployed to Iraq in 2008 and returned back to the U.S. in 2009 after spending a year overseas. It's true that Beau Biden was awarded with a Bronze Star, which recognizes someone's bravery in the field and / or basically that they've gone above and beyond their role, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it's only awarded to those</a> who are directly in conflict against the enemy of the U.S. The Bronze Star is the fourth highest ranking in terms of awards, and has three categories: valor, merit, and achievement. It's unclear which Bronze Star Beau received.</p><p>Although we don't know exactly why Beau Biden was awarded with a Bronze Star, we do know that, while in Iraq, he must have shown heroism (such as saving the life of a soldier) or acted in a combat zone even if this wasn't his assigned role. (Those are just examples of what might earn a Bronze Star, FYI.)</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Beau Biden was not a loser. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hwzlZrjh75</a></p>— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) <a href=#>September 30, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Many were upset by Trump's disrespect toward Beau Biden.</h2><p>After Biden passionately brought up the memory of his son (while also referencing Trump's quote about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">veterans being "losers" and "suckers,"</a> a move Biden made to point out Trump's disregard toward the American military), Trump responded, "Oh really?

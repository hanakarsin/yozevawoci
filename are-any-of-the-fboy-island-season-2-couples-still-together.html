After realizing that neither guy was the right fit for her, she ultimately decided to take host Nikki Glaser up on her finale offer to take the entire $100,000 for herself.</p><p>Mia, meanwhile, only had <a href=#>FBoys</a> left (Danny Louisa and Peter Park). While it may have been tempting for her to take the money and run as well, Mia did feel a strong connection to Season 1 alum Peter. She chose him, and Peter confirmed that he was a reformed FBoy when he decided to split the money.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO Max</span></figure><p>Finally, Louise had the unique dilemma of choosing between her stronger connection, Mercedes Knox (FBoy), or Nice Guy Benedict Polizzi. She went with her heart and pursued Mercedes, who shocked viewers by splitting the money as well.</p><p>Though the final two episodes only dropped on HBO Max on Aug. 4, many months have passed since the three leads filmed Season 2. Are any of the FBoy Island Season 2 couples still together? Read on to find out what Tamaris, Louise, and Mia had to say about what they are up to now.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1.

However, the two are still very close, so there is always hope for a potential reconciliation down the line.</p><p>"Mercedes and I are on good terms," Louise shared with Distractify.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2.

Mia told us that she's been focusing her efforts on working, and on going to school.</p><p>"I've been busy trying to get myself back on track with graduating and becoming a doctor," Mia said about what she's been doing since her time on FBoy Island came to an end.</p><p>Like Louise and Mercedes, Mia and Peter are still friendly with one another.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3.

That was just like such a huge thing – at the end of the day, it was never for me to hurt him and and he knows that. We have a friendship, which is a beautiful thing," Tamaris said. "Whether Casey and I will ever be together, I don't know."</p><p>FBoy Island fans will have to keep their eyes peeled for further updates about the ladies' dating lives on their respective Instagram feeds.</p><p>You can follow <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Louise</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mia</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tamaris</a> on the app.</p><p>The first two seasons of FBoy Island are available to stream on HBO Max now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BmecCnsGanlmLBqbGMn5mosV2ewK2tzZ1krJ2RqLyveZFmmqitoKGytHnSraClpF2pvKix06Gcqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

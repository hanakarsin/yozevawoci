Source: InstagramNow that it's back for season 2, Too Hot to Handle is reminding all of us what it's like to be a sex-deprived hottie stranded on an island filled with other hotties. The series, which forces contestants to work together to try to win $100,000 while living in Caicos, was a phenomenon when it debuted last summer, in part because of its unique premise: The show's contestants are not allowed to have any sort of sexual contact."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The series, which forces contestants to work together to try to win $100,000 while living in Caicos, was a phenomenon when it debuted last summer, in part because of its unique premise: The show's contestants are not allowed to have any sort of sexual contact. Now, the show is back with a new slate of contestants.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Peter from 'Too Hot to Handle' on TikTok?</h2><p>One of the show's new contestants is <a href=#>Peter Vigilante</a>, a TikTok star who already had a substantial following on the platform before joining the show. Peter is a full-time personal trainer from Staten Island, and it didn't take him long after he made his debut on the show for him to start talking up his TikTok account.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>“Once you’ve got the following I’ve got – 100, 200 girls DM’ing you a day – and it’s really just like oh my god there’s so many I don’t know what to do,”&nbsp;Peter said in the season's first episode.</p><p>In addition to his TikTok account, Peter also has accounts on platforms like Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, and OnlyFans.</p><p>On TikTok, Peter has more than 2.2 million followers and 61 million likes on his profile, which is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@peter_vigilante</a>.</p><p>Peter mostly posts comedy sketches, workout videos, and challenges to his TikTok page, as well as a few choice thirst traps that involve spilling wine all over himself.</p><p>“I’m from Staten Island, New York. I’m a personal trainer, I’m an influencer on TikTok… I do thirst traps, and dance,” he said before showing off some of his moves. “I post a lot of different kinds of videos on TikTok. I think people just love seeing a dude with abs hop on a pole and spin."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Peter's stripper pole gave him a unique niche on TikTok.</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Refinery29</a>, Peter explained that he gained his following on TikTok in part by thinking through what specific brand of content he could provide to his followers.</p><p>“At first it was fitness, which I still do. But it’s like, ‘Ah, only so many people come back, now what do I do?’ Then, I buy a stripper pole," he explained. "People love seeing me strip. ‘Oh! Let’s get into thirst trapping.’ I was always doing a little bit of the thirst trap."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@peter_vigilante href=#>@peter_vigilante</a><p>I’m in time square baby! Also I ruined my Balenciagas for this so this better pop….</p><a title="♬ I See Red - Everybody Loves An Outlaw" href=#>♬ I See Red - Everybody Loves An Outlaw</a> <span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>"Then one day, my mom’s drinking wine. And I was like, ‘What if I chug the wine? People would&nbsp;love&nbsp;to see me steal my mom’s wine.’ And I chugged it and the wine dribbled down my chest. I didn’t even&nbsp;mean&nbsp;for it to be a thirst trap. And then every comment: ‘The wine down the chest. The wine down the chest.’ I was like, ‘Oh! Here’s my thing.’ So then I just turned into Wine Guy," he continued.</p><p>Since becoming wine guy, Peter has ruined a lot of different clothing spilling wine on himself. "Some stuff is ruined forever," he said. "I think my mom wore a white fur coat in one video or something. We just destroyed it. That one I felt bad about. After that one I took a little break.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbK1sdFmnaunnWLBsLuMoaatZaSkeqmtzZ2jnmWknri1u8o%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

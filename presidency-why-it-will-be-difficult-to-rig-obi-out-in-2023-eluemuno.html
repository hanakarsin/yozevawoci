Nigerians are set for a showdown if the man of the people is denied his victory.”</p><h2>Obasanjo Canvassing Support For Obi – Source</h2><p>The meeting between former president, <strong>Olusegun Obasanjo</strong>, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, <strong>Peter Obi</strong> and Rivers State Governor, <strong>Nyesom Wike</strong> reportedly discussed how to raise support for Obi’s presidential bid.</p><p>A source that spoke with Punch on <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>the details</a></strong> of the meeting, noted that Obasanjo met with Wike to seek his support for Obi in 2023.</p><p>The source who spoke on a possibility of an Obi/Wike alliance said, “Obasanjo is working on that, but many of us (Wike’s camp) prefer Tinubu.</p><p>“Tinubu has a political structure and base. Although Obi is ‘Obidient’, he doesn’t have a structure and base. Obi’s candidacy will only rub off on the PDP’s stronghold.”</p><p>Another close associate of Governor Wike noted that Obasanjo is supporting Obi based on the need for the South-East to produce the next president.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FvZqmqlai2pbHNnLBmr5iueqrAjLCgpaRdl7JusMifnaKbpaHBbsDOZqmin12kr6p5zq6rZqGeYn9xfpJmnKWtlaLCr7uO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

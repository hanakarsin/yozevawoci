Heck, you might even know the original song from the commercials, and I may or may not have auditioned for the nationwide commercial casting call in the 90's. But now, the beloved brand is rolling out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscar Mayer NotHotDogs</a>, and <a href=#>we tried</a> them to see what this meatless plant-based option is all about.</p><p>According to a press release, Kraft Heinz and NotCo are releasing two plant-based foods that are set to debut across the United States in 2024. One is the NotHotDog, and the other is the NotSausage. Both are made to be full of the same smoky flavors and textures you've come to expect from real meat. Except these are plant-based and are new additions to The Kraft Heinz Not Company's ongoing list of vegetarian-friendly and plant-based options.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Noah Fecks/Kraft Heinz Not Company</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">We tried Oscar Mayer NotHotDogs.</h2><p>Let me say, first and foremost, that I used to be a vegetarian. Call it a high school phase, but hey, it lasted a good two years, and I'm proud of that. With that being said, I know the smells, flavors, and textures that come from traditional plant-based "meats" and I can appreciate what most brands are trying to do. When I tried the NotHotDogs, I was reminded of the fake meat that often does the job for those who prefer not to eat actual meat. And that's not a bad thing.</p><p>To be honest, the texture isn't the greatest when you put it up against an actual Oscar Mayer hotdog. But the NotHotDog tastes close to the real thing, and it even has a bit of a snap to it. I had mine like my toddler eats hotdogs — on a plate with a glob of ketchup. But I would imagine that, dressed up in a bun with some toppings, the NotHotDog would taste even closer to the real thing.</p><p>That's not to say it's perfect, however. And I'm not pretending like it will permanently replace Oscar Mayer hotdogs in my home. I'm not sure I could get past the soft inside texture of these plant-based NotHotDogs in place of real meat. But they could be just right for those who are vegetarian or just interested in more plant-based foods.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tiffany Ⓥ (@yourneighborhoodvegan)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Oscar Mayer NotHotDogs debuted at Expo West 2024 in Anaheim, Calif.</h2><p>The NotHotDogs debuted in March 2024 at the Expo West in California, and they're set to be available nationwide later in the year.

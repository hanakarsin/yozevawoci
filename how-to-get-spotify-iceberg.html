However, others believe that it‚Äôs actually music that keeps us all connected. After all, it‚Äôs a universal art form that keeps us going in every aspect of our lives. And as a result, the <a href=#>Spotify</a> music platform plays a major role in how we communicate with one another. The app makes it easy to share your music library with friends and show off which artists you favor.</p><p>Spotify users always make it a point to brag about their music taste, and now there's a new web app called Icebergify to help you do just that ‚Äî with the help of a unique iceberg image.</p><p>But, what exactly does the Spotify Iceberg entail? How do you use Icebergify? Keep reading to get all your answers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Icebergify is a tool that allows Spotify users to showcase their most-listened-to artists with an iceberg graphic.</h2><p>Hooray for technology! According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Teal Mango</a>, Icebergify is a third-party website that comes in handy to show off your favorite artists to your friends.</p><p>By going to the Icebergify site, Spotify users now have the ability to feature their most-listened-to artists in a cool iceberg graphic, listing the names from top to bottom.</p><p>To make the iceberg, Icebergify collects data from your personal Spotify account, and then uses additional ranking tools that factor in artists' popularity. So, while you may make it a point to bump <a href=#>J. Cole</a> on the regular, the rapper may rank lower on the Iceberg if you also have a deep affinity for <a href=#>Taylor Swift‚Äôs</a> music.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Quote this tweet with yours spotify iceberg <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hJfi6Qqben</a></p>‚Äî Ade Kurniawan (@krulisme) <a href=#>June 29, 2022</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How to get a Spotify Iceberg:</h2><p>Now that you understand what the Spotify Iceberg entails, it‚Äôs time for you to seek out your own graphic. To kick things off, head over to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Icebergify website</a>. Next, select ‚ÄúCreate Yours‚Äù and proceed to sign in to your Spotify account.</p><p>Then, you‚Äôll want to give the app permission to access your Spotify data. Once the site has acquired permission, there will be a brief period while the site collects and processes the information needed to create the Iceberg. Once complete, you‚Äôll have an Iceberg to show off to your friends and family, so go ahead and save or screenshot it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Was really confused by this until I saw it works by artist popularity, not how much I listen to the artists. Now Taylor Swift being there makes sense, I have maybe 3 songs in one of my playlists.</p><p>Anyways, Spotify iceberg: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Ub7r7Dt9AL</a></p>‚Äî Elizabeth üå∫ (@elizabvns) <a href=#>June 26, 2022</a></figure><p>Keep in mind, technology is great, but it‚Äôs not always perfect. With that said, you may experience a delay or a ‚Äú500 Internal Error‚Äù message on the page. If that does occur, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LifeHacker</a> suggests that you may have to refresh and keep trying a few times.</p><p>So, if you‚Äôre interested in seeing where your Spotify list stands, give the Icebergify tool a try.

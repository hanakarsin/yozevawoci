However, some fans believe she will give birth in just a matter of weeks ‚Äî wait, why is that? Well, the Gully Boy actress took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> on Oct. 24 and wished her nearly 72 million followers a happy <a href=#>Diwali</a> alongside two photos. The first is a throwback picture, and the second image is of her lying in bed.</p><p>"Happy Diwali from throwback me as current me is spending Diwali in bed.

The lawmaker further stated that he remains a member of the APC until he announces his defection on his social media platforms.
The visit of Peller, who lost the Oyo North Senatorial ticket, to a chieftain of the New Nigeria People’s Party, Adebisi Olopoeyan, last week triggered speculations that he had dumped the APC."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Also, while some speculate that I am now a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, some conclude I am now in Accord Party. This is nothing but a rumour and should be regarded as one by all as I remain a member of the APC until I announce otherwise via my verified social media handles.</p><p>“That I honoured Alhaji Adebisi Olopoeyan’s invitation to his house doesn’t mean I have defected to NNPP. Alhaji Olopoeyan is a family friend, and the fact that we belong to different political parties doesn’t mean I should start playing politics of bitterness with him. I am not that kind of a person and won’t turn to one for political reasons.</p><p>“It would be recalled that about a week ago, one of the chieftains of our party in Oyo State, had also alleged that I am being secretly positioned by the Peoples Democratic Party to be a running mate to Governor of Oyo State, Engr. Seyi Makinde in the 2023 Oyo State gubernatorial race. This is also not true, and the recent announcement of Bayo Lawal as a running mate to Governor Makinde has further rendered the allegation baseless.</p><p>“That I commended Governor Makinde on a project that is beneficial to my constituents shouldn’t make one conclude that I am now a PDP member. Also, Engr. Seyi Makinde is not a governor to PDP members only, but a governor to everyone in Oyo State including myself. I haven’t defected from APC to any political party, and even if I am going to do so, that would be for the people of Oke Ogun in Oyo State to decide.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e49vZmtoYmh6tLTIp5hmqJWhuaa%2BjKynnpmbqHqwuoydrKaomaO0bq3PnGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

By the 22nd, it will be exactly 7 days after the University received our request. Failing to provide a response by the 22nd can only mean three things: 1) it has failed the first test on accountability and transparency. 2) it has defied an extant law requiring it to avail such information on request. 3) it sadly has something to hide about this action that has attracted general public opprobrium.”</p><p>Chijioke said that if the Alumni did not receive a response by the said date, after having given the University Management the opportunity to clarify itself,&nbsp;“it will then be appropriate to draw inference from the information available to the Alumni and then take further action”.</p><p>He said that the association “will take further actions which include a public statement updating the Alumni community on the actions so far and the no-response from the university as well as compel the university to provide the records and proceedings leading to this decision.”</p><p>He, therefore, urged all members to patiently wait for the seven days the law has granted the University to respond, adding that if they failed to respond, the association would be acting within the law to proceed with our next further action.</p><p>The national president pointed out that their letter asked 12 questions which are:</p><p>“To provide to&nbsp;FUTO&nbsp;Alumni&nbsp;Association&nbsp;National&nbsp; Executive&nbsp; Council the records of the proceedings of the&nbsp; University&nbsp; Governing&nbsp; Council meeting at which this appointment was made.</p><p>“To know the register of the&nbsp;Council members in attendance at the time this appointment was approved.</p><p>“The extant university and Nigerian University Commission’s procedure for the appointment of professors.&nbsp;</p><p>“Details of the advert for this professorial position.&nbsp;</p><p>“Details of the application(s) received for this position.</p><p>“Details of the academic publications by Mr Isa&nbsp; Ali&nbsp; Ibrahim Pantami on which basis he was examined and offered this appointment.</p><p>“Details of all other publications by&nbsp; Mr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“The resume of Mr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami submitted in support of his application which details his academic records and work experience in the academia.&nbsp;</p><p>“The names of the examiners appointed and responsible for the assessments of&nbsp; Mr&nbsp; Isa&nbsp; Ali&nbsp; Ibrahim Pantami’s application and publications for the purpose of this appointment/promotion.&nbsp;</p><p>“The resume of all the professorial examiners of&nbsp; Mr&nbsp; Isa&nbsp; Ali&nbsp; Ibrahim&nbsp; Pantami for the purpose of this appointment.&nbsp;</p><p>“The report of the assessment by the professorial examiners of Mr Isa&nbsp; Ali&nbsp; Ibrahim&nbsp; Pantami.&nbsp;</p><p>“Any other information,&nbsp; documents or records considered relevant and useful on this subject matter”.</p><p>The Alumni pointed out that the sad development was unacceptable and a great dent to their collective credentials while assuring to approach their engagement in such a way to give amble leverage to legally neutralize the ignoble action by the university.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FtZqmZnqmurrXSZqerp5aawLS70ayfoqhdm8K1u4ygqZqcpZbBpr%2BMq5ygqpWpeqe%2BwK6brKyVp8Buwc2irZ6qo57BunnTmp5mnJWirq%2BwjJ6vqaSRo661tc6nZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Trina returns to retrieve the cell phone she forgot, and she literally runs into the stalker. She tries macing the stalker, but the canister is empty. So instead, she tries to escape. But something above Trina and the stalker’s heads distracts them both.</p><p>Cut to: Trina, drenched with what looks like blood, arriving at her own graduation party at The Savoy, to the shock and horror of everyone in attendance, including mom Portia (Brook Kerr).</p><p>And the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">preview</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;General Hospital&nbsp;episode airing on Monday, July 5, shows Trina saying, “There was a trap.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Trina arrived cover with red!! 😲😱😳 <a href=#>@SydneyMikayla</a> <a href=#>#GeneralHospital</a> <a href=#>#GH</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/A2EJLVu2lh</a></p>— ☆𝐎𝐜𝐭𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐚☆ (@BillingsOctavia) <a href=#>July 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans have theories, including a ‘Carrie’ connection.</h2><p>Commenters on that&nbsp;Soaps.com&nbsp;recap are trying to parse out that twist ending, with one viewer speculating that the stalker is Nikolas’ son, Spencer. “Spencer is Ava’s stalker, [and] Trina got the bucket of blood over the head meant for Ava,” that viewer wrote.</p><p>Another concurred: “Was that [trap] set by the stalker and Ava was supposed to be covered in blood? That would make sense, Nik doing it to get the stalker makes no sense.”</p><p>And a third viewer compared the episode’s ending to the 1976 horror film&nbsp;Carrie, in which Sissy Spacek’s title character got doused with pig blood at her high school prom. “I’m guessing that maybe a bucket of blood fell on Trina, à la&nbsp;Carrie, which means the other person got away.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Trina meet Spencer <a href=#>#GeneralHospital</a> <a href=#>#GH</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ENtDUskbu6</a></p>— ☆𝐎𝐜𝐭𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐚☆ (@BillingsOctavia) <a href=#>July 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">IMDb seems to give away the identity of the stalker.</h2><p><strong>General Hospital</strong><strong>&nbsp;spoilers ahead!</strong></p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Soap Hub</a>, Ava will meet with Dante (Dominic Zamprogna) in Monday’s episode and tell him that she won’t put Trina in harm’s way at her gallery any longer.</p><p>And commenters on&nbsp;that&nbsp;post had ideas about the person behind the mask. “Trina called him a young dude and so it has got to be Spencer,” one wrote. “If they catch him, he will be in a whole world of trouble.”</p><p>Another wrote, “Trina really doesn’t know that the stalker is a ‘dude.’ She just assumed.

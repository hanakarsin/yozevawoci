He opens up space for a strike on his left foot, but Bailly makes the block to deny him</p><p>31'&nbsp;Nolito and Marouane Fellaini have a frank exchange of views after the former accuses the latter of dragging out of his shirt as he attempted to sprint into the United penalty area</p><p>30'&nbsp;Mkhitaryan is flagged for offside as he chases a ball through the centre. He doesn’t hear the whistle, goes down under a challenge from Claudio Bravo and appeals for a penalty, but none is forthcoming</p><p>27' Man City have pretty much dominated so far</p><p>24'&nbsp;Rooney plays the ball down the right wing for Henrikh Mkhitaryan to chase.

Wayne Rooney and Guardiola in a scuffle for a ball which went out for throw in...the two actually make up</p><p>20'&nbsp;City patiently build from the left with Nolito and Kolarov. The left-back whips a cross with pace to the back post, but Sterling cannot twist to get a header on target</p><p>17' COUNTER!!!

It’s been reasonably entertaining so far</p><p>10' Man City has started playing impressively now...De Bruyne's incisive pass to Iheanacho is snuffed out by Bailly and Valencia with the latter clearing</p><p>9' Frekick...Eric Bailly fouls De Bruyne on the edge of the box but his the set piece is well over</p><p>8' WHAT A SHOT!!! Pogba definately has his shooting boots on. ROoney makes run through the middle and finds Mkhitaryan on the right who immdiately lays for Pogba who plays a one time shot.</p><p>The ball is a lob and Bravo is well beaten but its just over</p><p>6'&nbsp;The first corner of the afternoon is poor as Silva's ball fails to beat the first man, allowing the home side to clear</p><p>5'&nbsp;Otamendi sends a neat&nbsp;pass throught the United defence for the run of De Bruyne. The Belgian puts a dangerous ball across the face of goal, but neither Iheanacho or Sterling can convert in the penalty area</p><p>4'&nbsp;Wayne Rooney picks up the ball on the edge of the City penalty area and plays it wide to Antonio Valencia on the right touchline.

We know their formation, we know their dynamics and nobody has doubts.</i></p><p><i>"They have so many options that for us in the preparation of the game, we have to go step by step, we have to go situation after situation because we try to reduce the unpredictability of the game, you know?"</i></p><p>Manchester City manager<strong> Pep Guardiola:</strong>&nbsp;<i>"Let me live this derby and after I can tell you how it can compare with Spain and Munich. I think that for the media on both sides, in Spain and here, it's similar.</i></p><p><i>"I saw the four official games United have played and in every game they've played better than in the one before. Like us.</i></p><p><i>"Set pieces with tall guys it's impossible to control that, they're taller than us. They're a top team, like Manchester United always is."</i></p><p><strong>Head-to-head</strong></p><p>Of the 171 games played between the two sides, United have won 71, with 51 draws; City have only managed 49 wins.</p><p><strong>Kick-off:</strong>&nbsp;12.30pm</p><p><strong>Venue:&nbsp;</strong>Old Trafford</p><p>Follow our live coverage of the game from 12:30pm</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhnd%2Fk21nZqWRo7CpsdKtnKtlpaO2tbHDZq2sZZ2Wu6S0xKyrnqpdmLa1xYypqZ6umZrEb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

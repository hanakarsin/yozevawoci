Twitter is the best avenue for young Nigerians. Look it up. Indonesian teens make between $10 and $20 by tweeting for every small business out there,”</i>&nbsp; Omololu-Olunloyo disclosed.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;Kemi Olunloyo Shows Off The Man She Wants To Marry&nbsp;</p><p>Kemi also notes that sports present huge prospects for those who want to commercialize their passion.</p><p><i>“Nigerian youths can do what Indonesian teens have done monetizing soccer tweets.

I agreed and in February 2004, Facebook launched as a university social network. Later in 2006, it rolled out to the public. This event made me the first Nigerian on Facebook. I later joined Instagram October 10, 2010, four days after it was released. By 2011, I joined Pinterest. Currently, I am again a beta tester for the new social network called Ello.”</i></p><p>Kemi also added:&nbsp;<i>“On Twitter, I aggregate world news and monetize tweets. For example, I have Canadian and American musicians that tweet their music with me. A typical affordable tweet package is three tweets for $50 to $150 per tweet. I tweet their tracks to my followers.While abroad, there were companies that hired me to tweet reality shows, award shows and live events. That was very lucrative.”</i></p><p>And here are the latest tweets by Kemi&nbsp; Omololu-Olunloyo:</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXmCkmpnZqFdmq6zuoxuZ2aolad6tcPEnqtmnahitLDC0mabmq2XncGmvoyknKahXaS5trrLqLCoZpipuq0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

In the latest season, Zoe leaves Cal U to pursue a career in the fashion industry and discover if it “is all it’s cracked up to be or if she still has some growing left to do,” according to showrunners.&nbsp;</p><p>The second half of the series, which was set to premiere last summer, was ultimately delayed in an attempt to follow COVID-19 protocols in Los Angeles country, where the virus ran rampant. Yara told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Line</a>, “Initially, this was supposed to come out this past summer as a kind of seamless continuation. But I think, fortunately, people are still excited after our long hiatus. We’re trying to be as COVID safe and responsible as possible.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>The 20-year-old black-ish actress went on to explain that now that the show has returned from its brief hiatus, cast members have already started to prepare for Season 4 of grown-ish, which was renewed in late January.&nbsp;</p><p>She continued, “There are a lot of protocols in place, and unfortunately, L.A. isn’t doing really great right now in terms of COVID overall. We are waiting on the go-ahead because we’re dealing with a perpetually pushed start date. But on the bright side, we’ve already started reading scripts … the preview I’ve gotten of Season 4 has been super exciting, and we’ll be on set in no time.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The cast of 'grown-ish' are friends IRL.</h2><p>Acting alongside Yara on the star-studded cast of grown-ish are R&B duo <a href=#>Chloe x Halle</a>, Trevor Johnson, Diggy Simmons, and Francia Raisa, who are all friends in real life.

She is a businesswoman, a college grad, somebody who runs her own businesses and is making music. I think that's something that runs through the whole cast, being a multi-hyphenate. That comes through even in her character. You may meet her briefly, but you can't name her character, Indigo, as one thing.”&nbsp;</p><p>grown-ish airs on Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on Freeform.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxll6e8uLqMoqqhZZaeua6xww%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

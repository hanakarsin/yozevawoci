He is inconsequential and I want you to put it on social media.</p><p>“I was in Paris and I told Mr President that the leaders of the South-East would want to visit him over the issue of peace in the South-East, and I appeal to him to postpone the visit till early next year.</p><p>“But I didn’t want to tell our people, because I was urging them to keep pushing our projects as if the President was going to come this year. And I’m not sure up to three or four people knew this; so, I kept it to myself.</p><p>“So, Mr. President will come when we want him to come. That IPOB guy is an inconsequential human being. If he is serious, let him hit the wall to Ebonyi State and let him see, if he would find feet to go back.</p><p>“Somebody will sit down somewhere and be talking rubbish and they will be misguiding our children to go and be killed; but, himself will not be at the war front.</p><p>“Any of them that will talk rubbish about security in South-East, should come and lead the war. And I will also lead the war for Ebonyi State. And like David, we will always kill Goliath.</p><p>“When they talk rubbish, just ignore them.

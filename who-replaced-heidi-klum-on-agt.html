She's a fair, but firm presence on the NBC show ‚Äî not to mention, the fashion guru has brought along her decent-sized fan base thanks from her modeling and Project Runway days.</p><p>So you can imagine how concerned viewers were when instead of seeing Heidi next to Simon Cowell, Sofia Vergara, and Howie Mandel halfway through the June 16 episode of AGT, there was someone else entirely. But who replaced Heidi in Season 15? Let's take a deep dive into the unique situation.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who replaced Heidi in 'AGT'?</h2><p>On June 16, fans took notice when, instead of Heidi sitting next to Simon, Sofia, and Howie, someone else was sitting in her chair about halfway through the episode. The audition episodes were filmed in early March 2020, right around when the novel coronavirus started impacting the U.S. in big ways.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wait Heidi seriously didn‚Äôt show up for the second half?

"I told them how I was feeling. They looked at me, checked me out and said, 'Yeah, go home.' Then I was asked to get tested ASAP so that I could go back to work because we didn't know that this was all unfolding the way it did.

To be safe, we are staying apart until we get the results of our Coronavirus tests (that we were finally able to get today) back. We don‚Äôt want to spread germs and risk others getting sicker... even each other! As much as I want to embrace him and kiss him, it is more important to do the right thing and not spread further. ‚ù§Ô∏è These are strange times... but in these moments, you remember what‚Äôs really important- the people you love and keeping them safe. Social distancing is what we all need to do right now to be responsible citizens of the world. We are all in this together and it is up to us to protect our loved ones, and our neighbors and our communities. Please listen to the officials and stay at home if you can and physically distance yourself from other people‚Ä¶ especially if you are not feeling well. I see all the beautiful things people are doing for each other all over the globe and that gives me hope! Sending all of you love and positivity and healing vibes‚Ä¶ together we can get through this but we need to be proactive so that we can all have a bright and healthy future. ü•∞üò∑‚úåüèªüßº‚ù§Ô∏è #socialdistancing #washyourhands #stayput #bekindtoeachother</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Heidi Klum</a> (@heidiklum) on Mar 14, 2020 at 7:02pm PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Although Heidi now seems to be in perfect health, Eric will be replacing her again on AGT on June 30, as he revealed via Instagram ahead of the audition episode airing.</p><p>"Hey all.

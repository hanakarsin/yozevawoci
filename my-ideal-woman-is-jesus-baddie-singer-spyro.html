Naija News reports that the ‘Who Is Your Guy’ crooner made this known in a recent interview with Hip TV.

That’s my spec: Know God, but be a baddie. Don’t be a mediocre because you know God. Dress well and speak well. Do those things that bad girls do but do it for your husband alone.</p><p>“In anything you do in life, you will always get criticised. And we just have to take a stance. It’s either you are hot or you are cold. It’s either you are for God or you are not for God.</p><p>“I’ve always known even before now that I’m going to get criticised for what I stand for. But it doesn’t mean it’s going to change. I’m a Christian and I make music. You can be a banker and still represent God in your field. I’m saying that I love God and I’m using my platform to talk about him. It doesn’t mean I shouldn’t go about my business.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye49yZqaxXZ6xpq3LZq6opZGjeqq%2FjKOcrK2jYq%2BisMOinGarmaO0pr6MrKeyqp9k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

However, in Episode 8, it was revealed he betrayed Alina by helping the Darkling/General Kirigan (Ben Barnes) create a powerful amplifier that would link their powers in perpetuity and turn Alina into a puppet.</p><p>David also had a mutual romantic interest in Genya (Daisy Head) during the time they both resided at the Little Palace, but their feelings remained unexpressed. Both of them joined the Darkling in his quest for power out of rebellion against the King and Queen of Ravka, but over time, both realized they chose poorly and attempted to undo the damage their betrayal of Alina had wrought.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>For most of Season 2, David is missing in action, having escaped after Alina defeated the Darkling in the Shadow Fold. When he returns for Genya, he realizes that the Darkling is past the point of redemption for his actions, and the pair attempt to flee to join Alina. Instead, the Darkling has been waiting for them, and he captures Genya while David escapes.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Genya is tortured for her betrayal of the Darkling, resulting in deep scars and the loss of an eye, while David makes his way to Alina. When the pair finally reunite, they begin a romantic relationship. David asks Genya what her favorite stone is, and they prepare to battle against the Darkling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does David die in 'Shadow and Bone'?</h2><p>At one point during the battle, David convinces Genya to hide in a dumbwaiter and seals it behind her as the Darkling's monsters, Nichevo’ya, attack them. When she's finally released, she notices blood splatter on the wall and realizes that David has died. On a sheet of paper nearby, she finds a sketch of a ring with a ruby, the favorite stone she mentioned earlier. Genya deduces David was going to propose and breaks down.</p><p>Sadly, David's fate is similar in the books, although he lives much longer. David's death doesn't arrive until a Fjerdian attack on his wedding day to Genya in the book Rule of Wolves, one of two spin-off novels from the original Shadow and Bone series about the adventures of Nikolai.</p><p>While fans are sad that David is gone, his and Genya's quiet love story has always been a fan-favorite. Shadow and Bone Seasons 1 and 2 are now streaming exclusively on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSdmaaesW6%2Fx5qbqK9dlrulecGopZ4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

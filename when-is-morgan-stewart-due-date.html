Morgan and Jordan's bundle of joy will likely be arriving in early 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>When she announced that she was pregnant in August of 2020, she also divulged that she was having a baby girl. She posted a video of her fiancÃ©, Jordan, popping a balloon that was filled with pink confetti.&nbsp;</p><p>"She may not be great at math but at least we know sheâ€™ll be well dressed," Morgan captioned the video.</p><p>Prior to the balloon reveal, Morgan had been convinced that she was not having a girl. She had visited a psychic who told her that she would get pregnant in April with a boy.&nbsp;</p><p>"We got pregnant really close to that month and she also ... Oh, she got the sex wrong," Morgan shared on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nightly Pop</a>.

The two had previously dated the decade before, but they weren't as compatible then.&nbsp;</p><p>"We dated 10 years ago for a year and then he broke up because he was like, 'I'm not down with you, b---h,'" Morgan shared during an Instagram Live, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. "And then I was like 'Fine, whatever, I'm over you, I don't care.' And then I went on obviously to have another relationship."</p><p>Morgan was, of course, referring to her subsequent relationship with Brendan. They got engaged on The Rich Kids of Beverly Hills in 2015, and they swapped vows in front of the cameras a year later.&nbsp;</p><p>Jordan and Morgan reunited toward the end of 2019, and it's clear that the rest was history.&nbsp;</p><p>"Then the past year we got back together," she continued on her Instagram Live. "Isn't that cute? He was persistent and I was like, 'all right.'"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Jordan is the youngest son of Dr. Phil and his wife, Robin McGraw.

People Daily</strong></p><p class=align-left>Lawrence Simon Warunge, the 22-year-old man who killed his parents, siblings and a worker has said he committed the offence since he felt unwanted and rejected by his family.</p><p class=align-left>Warunge, who described his parents as "killers and satanic", claimed his actions were motivated by a British TV drama titled Killing Eve.</p><p class=align-left>According to detectives, the suspect said he had planned to clear his family about three times and succeeded on January 2 so that he can "live with his girlfriend in peace".</p><p class=align-left>Warunge accused his siblings of siding with his parents in segregating him.</p><p class=align-left>After committing the heinous act, detectives say, the young man ate food cooked by his mother, watched TV and slept on his father's bed before embarking on a journey to Mahi Mahiu the following day at around 4am.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> Help us change more lives, join TUKO.co.ke’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Patreon programme</a></p><h2><strong>2. Daily Nation</strong></h2><p class=align-left><a href=#>President Uhuru's remarks</a> that maybe it was time for a person from another tribe to be the next leader have narrowed down the search for his successor to three of his key allies.</p><p class=align-left>The three include ODM leader Raila Odinga who has not declared interest in 2022 General Election, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and ANC boss Musalia Mudavadi.</p><p class=align-left>If Uhuru decides not to back anybody from the Kikuyu and Kalenjin communities as his possible successor, then it means Gideon Moi, who is from the same tribe as William Ruto will not receive the president's blessings.</p><p class=align-left>Ruto on Sunday, however, insisted that he was not going to bow out of the race stating he supported and voted for <a href=#>Uhuru because of policy and manifesto, not tribe</a>.</p><h2><strong>3. Taifa Leo</strong></h2><p class=align-left>Taifa Leo reports that the Jubilee Party had no plans of taking part in the Nairobi gubernatorial race following the impeachment of Mike Sonko.</p><p class=align-left>The ruling party had intended to have Sonko's deputy governor nominee Ann Kananu Mwenda to take over the office.</p><p class=align-left>This means that Sonko's move to go to court to stop the Nairobi by-election was a blessing to the Jubilee Party.</p><p class=align-left>The ex-county chief has, however, hinted at withdrawing the case from court to allow the by-election to continue.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong><a href=#>Click 'See First' under 'Follow' Tab to see Tuko.co.ke news on your FB Feed</a></p><h2><strong>4. The Standard</strong></h2><p class=align-left><a href=#>Senate Majority Leader Irungu Kang'ata</a> has maintained that the letter he wrote to President Uhuru indicating that the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) was unpopular, was in good faith.</p><p class=align-left>Kang'ata, who compared himself to a soldier who was calling for reinforcement from "headquarters" said he will be vindicated by the truth.</p>" I was like a general in a battlefield seeking reinforcement from the headquarters through a cable. It is unfortunate some platoons are saying the cable is false whereas it is clear we are under heavy attack.I was just reporting the truth as per the wishes of my constituents. I, however, regret leaking the letter," said Kang'ata.<h2><strong>5. The Star</strong></h2><p class=align-left>Teacher's union KNUT has threatened to oppose the BBI if the government (TSC) will not reinstate its membership.</p><p class=align-left>The union's boss Wilson Sossion said membership had shrunk to about 30,000 from over 180,000 and this has choked KNUT's operations due to sharply dwindling remittance.</p>"If the government decides to become stubborn, then we will be stubborn to support the BBI. The TSC should comply with the vitality of the law instead of applying blackmail in its undertaking. I can proudly say if that is the reason to remove me to step on the teachers, then I will rather die with them. I am not going anywhere," said Sossion.<p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish? Please reach us through news@tuko.co.ke or WhatsApp: 0732482690.

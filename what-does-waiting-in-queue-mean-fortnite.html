If you're a casual gamer who only has a bit of time here and there to play your favorite titles, it can be a bit of a bummer whenever you have difficulty getting right into the game. I can't recall the number of times I experienced a dreaded PS4 update when I just wanted to get a few quick matches of Street Fighter V in online, only to wait forever to actually log in to the game, and before I knew it, half of the time I had to play was gone doing, well, nothing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But what does it mean?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does "waiting in queue" mean in 'Fortnite'?</h2><p>As of this writing, Epic Games is worth a whopping $28.7 billion, which means that they have plenty of capital to ensure that their massively popular title runs smoothly across a wide breadth of platforms.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, sometimes things don't go smoothly for gamers who are trying to get into a Fortnite match, like when that pesky "waiting in queue" message comes on.</p><p>So why does this happen?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The most <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">probable reason</a> users might receive this message is because Fortnite is just so darn popular.

Unfortunately, there really isn't anything to be done.

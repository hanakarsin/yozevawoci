The two-step process includes:</p><h3>1. Contact a recruitment agency</h3><p class=align-left>The US Army has different branches. In the recruitment process, each location <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">has an agency</a>. The importance of the agency is to give you as a potential candidate all the required information about each branch. The agency representatives also answer all the questions you may have about the army.</p><h3>2. Report to Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS)</h3><p class=align-left>After contacting a recruitment agency, the general assumption is that you have a clear picture of what you want as a potential candidate and which branch in the army is ideal for you. At the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">MEPS</a>, you must take <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">different tests</a> to weigh your abilities as a person and more importantly, to understand which branch is ideal for you. If the MEPS representatives believe you are a qualified candidate, you take an oath of enlistment.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/705702e6f3d285af.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How long does a background check take for employment?</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> How to enroll in the British Army as a Kenyan citizen</p><h2>What should you know about US army recruitment for Africans?</h2><p class=align-left>There are two main things to note about US army application for foreigners. They include the following.</p><h3>Most of the steps are done online</h3><p class=align-left>US army is digitalised, and therefore, every step in the recruitment process is done through online platforms. This policy approach makes army jobs for non-citizens visible many people who are interested. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Go Army</a> is an ideal place to start the enlistment journey.</p><h3>In the recruitment process, information is king</h3><p class=align-left>The US army recruitment for non-citizens can be complex, especially if you are unsure about the army structure. For example. Marines’ age limit is 28 years while the Navy’s enlistment age limit is 39. Understanding the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">fine details</a> can help one in making proper decisions.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/895ff3cc4ab4844c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest means of submitting your CRB yearly return form for 2020/2021</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/252d60512bd68742.jpeg><h2>How to check if the enlisting was successful</h2><p class=align-left>After the application and going through MEPS, the next important step in the recruitment process is checking whether your application was successful or not. As earlier mentioned, the recruitment agency keeps most of your information digitally. Apart from information safety and centralising data, the system helps in notifying candidates on their scores and eligibility.</p><p class=align-left>After some weeks, the agency informs the candidates whether the enlistment was successful or not. Previously the government, through the recruitment agencies, used mails. Currently, potential candidates receive notifications through emails.</p><h2>How can I join the US Army from Kenya?</h2><p class=align-left>Kenyan nationals are among the current foreign soldiers in the US Army. For you (as a Kenyan) to join the USA army, you must meet the following requirements.</p><ul><li>You must have permanent residency status in the USA — primarily through the Green Card lottery.</li><li>You must be able to speak and write (mainly in English).</li><li>You must be of good (mental and physical) health.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1688d5c3b1fb874c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Everything you need to know about Kenya School of Flying fees structure, scholarships, location, contacts</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Recruitment requirements for the Kenyan army</p><h2>Can a non-US citizen join the Marines?</h2><p class=align-left>Unlike other armies in the world, you do not need to be a US citizen to join the army. However, there are some stipulations. Some of the requirements to join the marines include the following.</p><ul><li>You must be a permanent US resident for you to qualify.</li><li>If you live overseas, you must contact the US consulate and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">apply for permanent residency</a>.</li></ul><h2>Can you join the military without a green card?</h2><p class=align-left>No. You can only join the US military if you have a Green Card. Kenyans are e<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ligible for Green Card</a> and this eligibility bridges the gap for those willing to join the US Army. In the last three years, the rules around the Green Card have been flux. For example, as a Kenyan, you must have a Kenyan passport to meet the entry requirements.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c25583904bfff3ec.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>GSU recruitment, requirements, dates, centers and process</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In summary, it is possible to join the US Army as an African. The above steps outline what you should expect in the US Army recruitment for non-citizens. It is vital to keep up with policy updates as far as recruitment is concerned.

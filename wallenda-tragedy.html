In 1922, Karl put together a balancing act with his brother Herman, a man named Joseph Geiger, and a teenage girl named Helen Kreis (whom Karl eventually married). They joined the Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus and took their act all over the world. As the family grew, so did the act.</p><p>One of the Flying Wallendas‚Äô most impressive acts was the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>seven-person chair pyramid</u></a> ‚Äî four people made up the bottom layer, with padded shoulder bars yoking them into pairs. On top of those bars, two additional Wallendas balanced with another balancing bar between them. The person at the top of the pyramid sat in a chair balancing on that bar (and usually stood up on the chair midway through the act).</p><p>On Jan. 30, 1962, the Wallendas set out to perform the seven-person chair pyramid at the Shrine Circus at Detroit‚Äôs State Fair Coliseum. As always, the family performed without a safety net. The stunt failed.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Karl Wallenda walking a tightrope from two corners of the Tower Hotel with Tower Bridge in the background.</p></figure><p>Dieter Schepp (Karl‚Äôs nephew) was the front man on the bottom tier of the pyramid. He faltered and the pyramid collapsed, sending himself, Dick Faughnan (Karl‚Äôs son-in-law), and Mario (Karl‚Äôs adopted son) plummeting to the ground 32 feet below them. Dieter and Dick died, and Mario was paralyzed, confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.</p><p>Seventeen-year-old Jana Schepp (Karl‚Äôs niece) tumbled out of the chair at the top of the pyramid and clung to Karl‚Äôs back until a makeshift safety net was spread out below them. When she finally let go, she bounced out of the net and suffered a head injury. In just a manner of seconds, the Wallenda family had suffered incredible loss.</p><p>The Detroit State Fair tragedy was not the family‚Äôs last performance ‚Äî far from it. Sadly, it also wasn‚Äôt the last tragedy to befall the Wallenda family. In 1963, Karl‚Äôs sister-in-law Rietta fell to her death during a performance in Omaha, Nebr. In 1972, Karl‚Äôs son-in-law Richard ‚ÄúChico‚Äù Guzman died when he touched an electric wire and part of some metal rigging. And in 1978, Karl himself fell.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Just a few practice steps before I make my way across the active Masaya Volcano this Wednesday on ABC. #volcanolivewithnikwallenda</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Nik Wallenda</a> (@nikwallenda) on Mar 2, 2020 at 4:31pm PST</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Karl Wallenda‚Äôs fatal fall occurred in Puerto Rico.</h2><p>At the age of 73, Karl attempted a walk between the two 10-story towers of the Condado Plaza Hotel in San Juan. A combination of high winds and an improperly secured wire caused Karl to lose his balance and fall. He was brought to the hospital and pronounced dead on arrival.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The Wallenda tragedies haven‚Äôt kept the family from performing.</h2><p>No one would blame Nik and the rest of his family members for avoiding the tightrope after these family tragedies, but it doesn‚Äôt seem as though that‚Äôs an option. Nik is not deterred by his family history. Instead, he‚Äôs inspired by it and he aims to continue the incredible legacy first set in motion by his great-grandfather. If anyone can cross that volcano, it‚Äôs definitely Nik.

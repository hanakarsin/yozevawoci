Can't break that," reads the caption of the photo Kristin and Jay posted.&nbsp;</p><p>The picture had a seismic impact on fans, many of whom have immediately interpreted it as a sign that the stars have changed their minds since filing for <a href=#>separation in April 2020</a> and are now ready to give the relationship another shot.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In a court filing, Kristin cited irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct as the main reason behind the divorce.

At least that's according to Nick (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@nickfromohio</a>), a T<a href=#>ikToker</a> who said that they were asked to swap seats with someone who ended up getting "escorted" off the plane "by security."</p><p>Nick says that he was "exhausted" on the flight because it was set to take off at 5 a.m. He "planned accordingly," made it on the flight in time, went to his seat at the back of the plane in Row 20, and sat down to close his eyes and hopefully get some sleep.</p><p>However, he woke up to a "tap" on his shoulder from some dude in his "early 40s" who asked Nick if he would be cool enough to switch seats.</p><p>Even through his morning grogginess, Nick decides to ask the guy "why" and the man proceeded to tell him it's because his two kids are going to be on the flight and their seats just so happen to be assigned to the empty ones next to Nick.</p><p>The man then told him that his own seat was closer to the front of the plane in Row 7, which meant that he would ultimately get off the plane sooner upon landing.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@nickfromohio href=#>@nickfromohio</a><p>Why can no one just be normal on planes <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=airplane href=#>#airplane</a> <a title=storytime href=#>#storytime</a> <a title=mean href=#>#mean</a> <a title=arguments href=#>#arguments</a> <a title=airplanes href=#>#airplanes</a> <a title=confrontation href=#>#confrontation</a> <a title=annoying href=#>#annoying</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - RANTS FROM THE SHOWER" href=#>♬ original sound - RANTS FROM THE SHOWER</a></figure><p>Nick thought it was weird that the guy's justification for the desired seat switch was so he could sit next to his kids; however, Nick saw there was a potential problem with this excuse — and it's that there weren't any kids with him. Nor were there any people in the seats next to him or anyone else who seemed to be traveling with this man.</p><p>Nick added that he was "tired" and didn't really want to get up out of his seat after he plopped down to settle in for the flight. The TikToker informed the gentleman that he was tired and wasn't really interested in moving his stuff around and re-adjusting himself for this leg of the journey.</p><p>That's when the guy offered to move everything up for him and stated that he'd find himself snuggled up in a new seat in no time.</p><p>Nick, however, declined the guy's offer again, stating that he was just going to chill there, and then he asked the guy where his kids were. "Why do you wanna know?" the man asked back, before explaining that his children were at the front of the plane still getting their bags.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @nickfromohio</span><p>"'No' is a complete sentence," wrote another commenter</p></figure><p>Nick said that this made him think that the guy's kids were older but even if they weren't, he didn't really need to sit by them because everyone was on the plane together and the kids were going to be fine.</p><p>"You're serious, you're not gonna let a father sit next to his kids?" the guy countered back to Nick, who said at this point in the conversation, people began looking at the two of them.</p><p>Nick thought that was the end of the conversation right then and there, but the man came back with two people, one of whom who asked Nick to switch seats with their father. Nick was surprised to see that the "kid" was someone his own age, aka a full-grown adult.</p><p>"I'm like, these kids aren't young," he said, even further solidifying the fact that they didn't need to sit next to an adult to be comforted during a flight.</p><p>Nick, still not wanting to give up his seat, ended up getting into an argument with the family about seating arrangements. The dad's son asked Nick why he just couldn't seem to grasp the concept of a family wanting to sit with each other on a plane.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @nickfromohio</span></figure><p>Nick said that all he wanted to do was get in his chair earlier in the flight so he could just chill and not be bothered but now he found himself being "berated" by a father and his two sons who wanted him to just swap out seats so they could all sit together.</p><p>After they started going back and forth for a bit, a flight attendant came up to see what the deal was.</p><p>It was at this point in the conversation that Nick says the dad accuses him of stealing his seat and when Nick countered back, the dad said that Row 7 was actually Nick's seat. The TikToker, flabbergasted that the man would try to "pull" such a move, ended up taking out his plane ticket to show that he was, indeed, assigned this seat.</p><p>After Nick presenting his electronic boarding pass on his phone to the flight attendant, she then asked the dad if she could see his own boarding pass, but he declined and even went so far as to accuse Nick of stealing his ticket ... which would be a tall order for someone to pull off with a mobile one.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @nickfromohio</span></figure><p>Nick broke down the situation to the flight attendant stating that the man approached him to switch seats and that he was traveling with two "grown men" and so it shouldn't be a problem if they were sitting apart from each other for a brief two-hour flight because once it's done, they'll be "reconnected" with each other.</p><p>Nick went on to state that it was 5 in the morning, he was exhausted, and he just wanted to chill in his chair and get some rest until landing.</p><p>The dad didn't like this response; Nick said he began "screaming" at him while calling the TikToker every name in the book. The man's kids then tried to calm him down and begged their dad not to blow up or get physically aggressive and "punch" anyone.</p><p>The dad ended up getting escorted to his seat and then his two kids had to sit next to Nick on the airplane while they "mean [mugged]" him. It was a consequence that the TikToker didn't consider — now he had to fly the whole time with these two guy giving him dirty looks for the entirety of the flight.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @nickfromohio</span></figure><p>But the dad wasn't done — he ended up running back down the plane after breaking free from the flight attendant to accost Nick. His son stood up and tried to hold his dad back while other people on the plane started panicking because they had no idea what was going down.</p><p>Nick said that the man ended up getting kicked off the flight, leaving his two sons to fly without him. And Nick — for the inconvenience — ended up getting bumped to first class.</p><p>He said at the end of the video he may have started off by warning folks not to switch seats with folks, but that the actual moral of his story was that people should probably just plan their trips better.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbyvwIysrqKsk516tLHArapmp55iva2tzZ4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
